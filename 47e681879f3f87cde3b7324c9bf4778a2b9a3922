      "message": "The code here is added to read what comes AFTER the META_PLACEABLE record and WMF header and calculate aPlaceableBound.\n\nThis part of the WMF data was previously ignored, but META_SETWINDOWORG (0x20b) and META_SETWINDOWEXT (0x20c) are among the records that should be read in order to calculate the correct bounds. We skip 22+18\u003d40 bytes to reach to the place after WMF header: 22 bytes for META_PLACEABLE and 18 bytes for the WMF header. Then we call GetPlaceableBound to read and calculate the bounds.\n\nThis skipping of bytes to reach exactly after the WMF header is something similar to what we see after the second else, in line #1472. So, I thought this way of reading bounds should be OK. The only difference there is that it skips 18 bytes, because that else comes when there is no 22 bytes META_PLACEABLE header.\n\nThe checksum was previously ignored. Are you suggesting that I should check the correctness of checksum? I can do that in a followup.",
