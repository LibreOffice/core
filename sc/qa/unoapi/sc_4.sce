# The two HeaderFooter tests seem to fail randomly

# SHF_TextObj is composed of SHF_TextData, which has a weak reference to
# SHF_ContentObj, which itself has three references to SHF_TextObj.
# The css::text::XTextRange test fails often when the weak SHF_ContentObj is
# already gone. If just this test is disabled, later tests of this object fail
# too, so this disables the whole interface.
