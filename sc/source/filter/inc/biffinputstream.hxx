/** This class is used to read BIFF record streams.

    An instance is constructed with a BinaryInputStream object. The passed
    stream is reset to its start while constructing this stream.

    To start reading a record call startNextRecord(). Now it is possible to
    read all contents of the record using operator>>() or any of the read***()
    functions. If some data exceeds the record size limit, the stream looks for
    a following CONTINUE record and jumps automatically to it. It is NOT
    allowed that an atomic data type is split into two records (e.g. 4 bytes of
    a double in one record and the other 4 bytes in a following CONTINUE).

    Trying to read over the record limits results in a stream error. The
    isValid() function indicates that by returning false. From now on the data
    returned by the read functions is undefined. The error state will be reset,
    if the next record is started.

    The import stream supports decrypting the stream data. The contents of a
    record (not the record header) will be encrypted by Excel if the file has
    been stored with password protection. The functions setDecoder() and
    enableDecoder() control the usage of the decryption algorithms.
    setDecoder() sets a new decryption algorithm and initially enables it.
    enableDecoder( false ) may be used to stop the usage of the decryption
    temporarily (sometimes record contents are never encrypted, e.g. all BOF
    records or the stream position in SHEET records). Decryption will be
    reenabled automatically, if a new record is started with the function
    startNextRecord().
