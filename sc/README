Spreadsheet application code.

You can dump some information in a dbgutil build:

=== CTRL+SHIFT+F12 ===

=== CTRL+SHIFT+F11 ===

Dumps the graphic objects and their position and size in pixel.

=== CTRL+SHIFT+F9 ===

Dumps the SfxItemSet representing the cell properties' of the
current selection as a xml file. The file will be named dump.xml

=== The Cache Format ===

ScDocument::StoreTabToCache allows storing the content (not the formatting)
of a table to a binary cache format.

The format is column orientated which allows quick serialization of the table.
