      "message": "I\u0027m not sure this \"forwarding\" is really needed. LO and the used Qt style are normally synced, so using the default font should work. Maybe applying the scale factor is needed there too?\n\nOr this whole font handling can be dropped from getNativeControlRegion, as that should already contain the height of the text LO wants to paint and this should just add some \"border\" for the widget styling. This is very old code, which was just ported from the old KDE3 codebase. Never checked that.",

      "message": "You\u0027re probably referring to the code I removed in Qt5Graphics_Controls.cxx:\n\nQApplication::fontMetrics().height()\n\nUnfortunately I had to implement this portion of code because this line above was providing values different from the size LO apparently wants to use. For instance, if I add this code in Qt5Graphics_Controls.cxx:\n\nconst int nHeight \u003d val.getFontHeight();\nconst int systemHeight \u003d QApplication::fontMetrics().height();\nprintf(\"nHeight: %d, system: %d\\n\", nHeight, systemHeight);\n\nI get:\n\nnHeight: 27, system: 16\n[...]\nnHeight: 30, system: 16\n\nThe scale I set for my display is 2.\n16 should be scaled according to the factor, but it would be too big. I did not investigate much into this, cause I thought LO may want to draw fonts of different sizes.\nIf you have a better idea, please let me know.",

That results in a bad rendering and also no border around some controls. So I added a bit of margin around the text (which is then scaled).
