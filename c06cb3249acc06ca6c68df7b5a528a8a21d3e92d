      "message": "This is not how to do code that conditionally executes based on different instruction sets. The file is compiled with AVX512F, so this may crash on any CPU that doesn\u0027t have AVX512F. The proper way to do this is to have a generic file that contains this function, and then have xxx_AVX.cxx etc. files that are compiled with relevant CPU flags and all code in it is executed only after the generic code detects that the CPU feature is available. See how the current code handles conditional use of SSE2.",
