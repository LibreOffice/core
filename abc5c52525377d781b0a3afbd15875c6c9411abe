Placed the controls in a GtkGrid, adjusted the distances so Notify is clearly related to Read Only and reduced the large spacing to the usual size. I added also some a11y information.\n\nLGTM now, and works like a charm. Last code check for Hossein.",

Or is it okay to just keep things as they are now?\n\nShould I also change the commit message as per the suggestions by Mike, and submit patch 5?",
