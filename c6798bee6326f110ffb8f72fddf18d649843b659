      "message": "Hi Caol√°n, the gtk3 version of treeview scroll_to_row, when passed a row that is visible with children collapsed, expands the children before scrolling the row into view. The sal version does not. In this patch I have removed the cause of this happening for the gtk3 version. Would a separate patch for this be better than including it here?",
