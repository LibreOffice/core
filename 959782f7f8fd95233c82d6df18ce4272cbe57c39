The libtool call always filters the gcc -B option, maybe confusing it with some linker option? Guess it was some mixup, where I mapped mold to gold, so libtool call would find and use gold instead of mold. At least that is my explanation. The -B is visible in the orcus Makefile call, if you run it with V\u003d1, but not in the libtool output.",
