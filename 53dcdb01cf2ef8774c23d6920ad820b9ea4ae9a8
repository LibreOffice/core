See e.g. https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/121890\n\nNo idea if it would be reasonable to check and replace those calls that are expected (?) to provide exactly the same object.",

      "message": "Note that, in general, dynamic_cast is not an adequate replacement for use of XUnoTunnel in C++ code.  (Think about scenarios where two C++ processes communicate, and process A uses XUnoTunnel on an object O from process B.  Even if B implements O as a class C that is also known to process A, a dynamic_cast\u003cC\u003e(O\u0027) on the proxy object O\u0027 for O in process A would fail.)",
