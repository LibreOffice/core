      "message": "okay this is now testing setting the background of every cell, but bug 91145 was about a more specific scenario:\nfirst multiple cells were selected, then a single cell was selected and only this single cell gets the background color set.\n\nthe bug was that other cells that were not selected also got the background color.\n\nso to test this you could first select multiple cells with e.g. SelectTableRow and then select a single one with SelTblBox.  then call SetBoxBackground() to set the new color.\n\nthen test that the one selected cell has the new color and all other cells have the old color.",
