      "message": "Not sure why SAL_TYPES_SIZEOFLONG is considered here. sal_Size is defined in include/sal/types.h to depend only on SAL_TYPES_SIZEOFPOINTER; and anyway, since this is not a part of public API, we may use \u0027if constexpr\u0027 of sizeof(n) to avoid all the complexity.\n\nI suspect that we might need to make use of the intrinsics conditional of __GCC__ defined (which is also true for clang IIRC?), and keep the old code as a fallback (do we need that?).",
