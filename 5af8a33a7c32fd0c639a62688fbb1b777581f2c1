      "message": "i was a bit concerned about this: there are some elements where it could cause problems, such as text:ruby, text:meta, text:meta-field (possibly text:input-field) as they are well-formed elements and so the text attributes in writer for hyperlinks are split into chunks that don\u0027t overlap these elements.\n\nbut when i try it out with this patch on master, i still get an overlapping hyperlink split into 2 at the text:ruby or text:meta boundary.\n\nnot sure how this works, but it seems to work.",
