      "message": "I don\u0027t know. Would need to get the ICC data of the colour spaces in question with CGColorSpaceCopyICCData, and look into that. I guess. It definitely is not the same as SRGB, though, as the built-in display on modern iMacs, at least, has a wider gamut than SRGB. I think. There doesn\u0027t seem to be any API to get the XYZ colors of the primaries of a CGColorSpaceRef. (Note that I don\u0027t really know if I am even using the right terminology here...)",
