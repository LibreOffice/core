      "message": "that won\u0027t compile.\n\n(and you need \"make dbglevel\u003d2\" to see that because of the \"#if OSL_DEBUG_LEVEL \u003e 1\")\n\nSAL_INFO does not work with printf format specifiers like %s but instead uses std::ostream like operator\u003c\u003c, so you need to convert that.\n\nalso, it\u0027s best to remove the \"#if OSL_DEBUG_LEVEL \u003e 1\" as well, having a SAL_INFO inside that doesn\u0027t really make sense.\n\nso you need to eliminate the \"aVal\" variable, that should be easy if you use uno::Any\u0027s \"has\u003cOUString\u003e()\" to check that it contains a string, and \"get\u003cOUString\u003e()\" to retrieve it.",
