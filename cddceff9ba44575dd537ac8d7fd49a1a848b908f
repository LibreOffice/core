I\u0027ll add you as a reviewer to the fix itself once it passes jenkins.\n\nI have no idea how to go about identifying why a unit test like this is failing, especially on platforms that I don\u0027t have. But since it isn\u0027t my fault (other than writing a unit test with calls that don\u0027t work everywhere) I\u0027m not going to worry about it.",
