      "message": "FWIW, I tried to identify and fix independent bugs with individual patches, which I found while working on this. But it\u0027s harder then expected, because it\u0027s a more fundamental change then I expected (and much more work).\n\nThis is something that compiles and seem to work on Windows and Linux. Current state is some first stab and MacOS, which I honestly don\u0027t believe to even compile.\n\nI would appreciate, if some MacOS dev could fix this for the platform. Is IOS supposed to still be a working build target?",
