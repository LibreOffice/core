== Image swapping ==

LO has two kind of swapout mechanisms:

1) Size based auto swapping: when the size of all graphic objects reaches a configurable limit (20 MB by default)
then some of the graphics are saved to the local file system and freed in the memory.
Configure: Tools -> Options -> Memory -> GraphicsCache -> Use for LibreOffice

2) Time based auto swapping: after an image is swapped in / loaded a timer starts and when the timer (1 min by default)
has a time out this image is swapped out ( sometimes this time out is ignored when the image is in use ).
Configure: Tools -> Options -> Memory -> GraphicsCache -> Remove from memory after

Both swapping are done by GraphicObject and GraphicManager.
