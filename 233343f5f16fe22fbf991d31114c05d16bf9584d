All other ScItemValue instances are added to a container with something like\n\n maDataItemValues.push_back(std::unique_ptr\u003cScItemValue\u003e(pItemValue));\n\nso probably that needs to be done here as well. However, I didn\u0027t check if adding the instance to maDataItemValues is actually the right approach or something else needs to be done for such a \"sub\"item.\n\nNitpick:\nInstead of creating a temporary aLabel OUString instance I\u0027d pass a const reference to the ScItemValue ctor.",
