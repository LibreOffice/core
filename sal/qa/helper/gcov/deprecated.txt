        rtl_str_trim;

# since 16.9.2003
# Function List:
# A. deprecated functions:
#    1) Profile class and all its sub C API:
        osl_openProfile;
        osl_closeProfile;
        osl_flushProfile;
        osl_readProfileString;

        osl_readProfileBool;
        osl_readProfileIdent;
        osl_writeProfileString;

        osl_writeProfileBool;
        osl_writeProfileIdent;
        osl_removeProfileEntry;

        osl_getProfileSectionEntries;
        osl_getProfileSections;

#    2) VolumeDevice class and all this sub C API:
        osl_releaseVolumeDeviceHandle;

        osl_acquireVolumeDeviceHandle;
        osl_getVolumeDeviceMountPath;

#    3) in FileBase class:
        osl_getCanonicalName;

# B. untested functions:
#    functions need Client/Server model and blocking mode of transmission. some of the functions
#    can not run through on testshl2 env while the same code can run successfully in normal seperate
#    files.
#    1) in DatagramSocket class:
#        osl_receiveFromSocket;
#        osl_sendToSocket;

#    2) in StreamSocket class:
#        osl_readSocket;
#        osl_writeSocket;
#        osl_receiveSocket;
#        osl_sendSocket;

#    3) in Socket class:
         osl_isExceptionPending;
#        osl_shutdownSocket;

#    4) in Pipe class:
#        osl_acceptPipe;

#    5) in StreamPipe class:
#        osl_readPipe;
#        osl_writePipe;
#        osl_receivePipe;
#        osl_sendPipe;

#C. unreachable functions
#    (*)in .map file but does not appear in.hxx header file thus unreachable,
#       mostly for internal use, can not be reached by accessing class, so need
#       not be tested.
