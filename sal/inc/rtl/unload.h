/** @file
The API enables an effective way of unloading libraries in a centralized way.
The mechanism ensures that used libraries are not unloaded. This prevents
crashes if library code is being used after unloading the library.
The unloading mechanism currently only works with libraries which contain
UNO services. A library cannot be unloaded if one of the following conditions
apply

<ul>
<li>An instance is still referenced </li>
<li>A module has been loaded without registering it </li>
<li>The service manager has created a one instance service </li>
<li>A service instance has been added to an UNO context </li>
</ul>

<b>Notification Mechanism</b>
The API provides a notification mechanism. Clients can use it to do clean up,
such as releasing cached references, in order to allow modules to be unloaded.
As long as someone holds a reference to an object whose housing module
supports unloading the module cannot be unloaded.<p>

Because of the inherent danger of crashing the application by using this API
all instances which control threads should be registered listeners. On
notification they have to ensure that their threads assume a safe state, that
is, they run outside of modules which could be unloaded and do not jump
back into module code as a result of a finished function call. In other words,
there must not be an address of the module on the thread's stack.
<p>
Since current operating systems lack APIs in respect to controlling the
position of threads within libraries, it would be a major effort to comply with
that recommendation. The best and most efficient way of handling the unloading
scenario is to let all threads, except for the main thread, die in case of a
notification.
<p>
Use this API with great care because it might crash the application. See the
respective documentation (Library Unloading) on the udk.openoffice.org web site.

/**
A library which supports unloading has to implement and export a function
called <code>component_canUnload</code>. <p>
If the function returns <code>sal_True</code> then the module can be safely unloaded.
That is the case when there are no external references to code within the
library. In case a module houses UNO components then the function must return
<code>sal_False</code> after the first factory has been handed out. The function then
continues to return <code>sal_False</code> as long as there is at least one object (factory
or service instance)  which originated from the module.<p>

Libraries which not only contain UNO components (or none at all) have to
provide a means to control whether they can be unloaded or not, e.g. However,
there is no concept yet. <p>

The argument <code>pTime</code> is an optional out-parameter. If the return value is
<code>sal_True</code> then <code>pTime</code> reflects a point in time since
when the module could have
been unloaded. Since that time the function would have continually returned
<code>sal_True</code> up to the present. The value of <code>pTime</code> is
important for the decision
as to a module will be unloaded. When someone initiates the unloading of
modules by calling <code>rtl_unloadUnusedModules</code> then the caller can specify a time
span with the effect that only those modules are unloaded which are unused at
least for that amount of time. If <code>component_canUnload</code> does not
fill in <code>pTime</code>
then the module is unloaded immediately.<p>

<code>component_canUnload</code> is implicitly called by <code>rtl_unloadUnusedModules
</code>. There is no need to call the function directly.

/**
By registering a module, one declares that a module supports the
unloading mechanism. One registers a module by calling this function.<p>

A module can only be unloaded from memory when it has been registered
as many times as it has been loaded. The reason is that a library can
be &quot;loaded&quot; several times by <code>osl_loadModule</code>
within the same process. The
function will then return the same module handle because the library will
effectively only be loaded once. To remove the library from memory it is
necessary to call <code>osl_unloadModule</code> as often as <code>
osl_loadModule</code> was called. The
function <code>rtl_unloadUnusedModules</code> calls <code>osl_unloadModule</code>
for a module as many
times as it was registered. If, for example, a module has been registered one
time less then <code>osl_loadModule</code> has been called and the module can be unloaded
then it needs a call to <code>rtl_unloadUnusedModules</code> and an explicit call to
<code>osl_unloadModule</code> to remove the module from memory. <p>

A module must be registered every time it has been loaded otherwise the
unloading mechanism is not effective.<p>

Before a module is registered, one has to make sure that the module is in a
state that prevents it from being unloaded. In other words,
<code>component_canUnload</code> must return <code>sal_False</code>. Assuming that
<code>component_canUnload</code>
returns <code>sal_True</code> and it is registered regardless, then a call to
<code>rtl_unloadUnusedModules</code> causes the module to be unloaded. This unloading can
be set off by a different thread and the thread which registered the module is
&quot;unaware&quot; of this. Then when the first thread tries to obtain a factory or
calls another function in the module, the application will crash, because the
module has been unloaded before. Therefore one has to ensure that the module
cannot be unloaded before it is registered. This is simply done by obtaining a
factory from the module. As long as a factory or some other object, which has
been created by the factory, is alive, the <code>component_canUnload</code> function will
return <code>sal_False</code>.<p>
Loading and registering have to be in this order:<br>
<ul>
<li>load a library (<code>osl_loadModule</code>)</li>
<li>get the <code>component_getFactory</code> function and get a factory</li>
<li>register the module (rtl_registerModuleForUnloading</li>
</ul>
Usually the service manager is used to obtain an instance of a service.
The service manager registers all modules which support the unloading mechanism.
When the service manager is used to get service instances than one does not
have to bother about registering.

there is no need to call this function unless one means to prevent the unloading of a module.

unloading listeners in order to give them a chance to do cleanup and get

registered module. If <code>sal_True</code> is returned then <code>osl_unloadModule</code>
is called for the belonging module as often as it is registered.
<p>
A call to <code>osl_unloadModule</code> does not guarantee that the module is unloaded even
if its <code>component_canUnload</code> function returns <code>sal_True</code>.

must be unused in order to qualify for being unloaded. By using this argument
one can counter the multithreading problem as described further above. It is in
the responsibility of the user of this function to provide a timespan big enough
to ensure that all threads are out of modules (see <code>component_canUnload</code>).

functions: <code>createSingleComponentFactory</code>, <code>createSingleFactory</code>,

The factory implementation is calling <code>rtl_ModuleCount.acquire</code> when it is being
constructed and it is calling <code>rtl_ModuleCount.release</code>. The implementations of
<code>acquire</code>
and <code>release</code> should influence the return value of <code>component_canUnload</code>
in a way that it
returns <code>sal_False</code> after <code>acquire</code> has been called. That is the module will not be unloaded
once a default factory has been created. A call to <code>release</code> may cause
<code>component_canUnload</code> to return <code>sal_False</code>, but only if there are
no object alive which

which have been created by these factories.
<p>
It is not necessary to synchronize <code>acquire</code> and <code>release</code> as a whole.
