    // On OS X when not sandboxed, soffice can restart itself via exec (see
    // restartOnMac in desktop/source/app/app.cxx), which leaves all file
    // descriptors open, which in turn can have unwanted effects (see
    // <https://bugs.libreoffice.org/show_bug.cgi?id=50603> "Unable to update
    // LibreOffice without resetting user profile"). But closing fds in
    // restartOnMac before calling exec does not work, as additional threads
    // might still be running then, which can still use those fds and cause
    // crashes. Therefore, the simplest solution is to close fds at process
    // start (as early as possible, so that no other threads have been created
    // yet that might already have opened some fds); this is done for all kinds
    // of processes here, not just soffice, but hopefully none of our processes
    // rely on being spawned with certain fds already open. Unfortunately, Mac
    // OS X appears to have no better interface to close all fds (like
    // closefrom):
