      "message": "I realize that the change is quite big; however, I don\u0027t see how to modularize it, given the renames needed to bear meaning of the meaning of the functions. And doing the renames one-by-one IMO would not decrease the volume much, but would introduce multiple repeated changes to the same files and often the same lines.\n\nDo you think it\u0027s ~reasonable in current form (modulo possible fixes when Jenkins shows my bugs), or do you have any suggestions? Thanks!",
