      "message": "The right test would have been:\n\n\u003e make libeot.clean \u0026\u0026 make\n\nIf you build a module, it ignores dependencies and doesn\u0027t parse the other *.mk files, except solenv/gbuild, Repository*.mk and config_host.mk. That\u0027s the reason makes \"start\" much faster to build single modules, then the whole tree. Your problem is dependency based, so a \"make libeot\" can\u0027t show the problem. FWIW you can often build unneeded dependencies by building the modules directly.",
