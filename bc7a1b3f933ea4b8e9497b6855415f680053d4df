      "message": "Sorry for stupid question: the code seem to work with some \"maximum\" rectangle 100000 x 100000? Is that some OOXML constant (I recall there was some similar 27000 thing or some such)? Or maybe 100% in 1/1000th of a percent units?\n\nAnd then - what is aFillRect? Is that not a rect, but an abused \"rect\" struct with simply four percentage values?\n\nThe formula only makes sense to me if both aFillRect.X1 and aFillRect.X2 mean \"so much offset from that side\", not respective position?",

      "message": "See core.git 33e69fb9ef450169e7d85ae3215fd9a4fc8082c2 for the commit that added the formula. If there is some correctness problem with that one, then perhaps best to comment on that original change.\n\nThis one just guards against dividing by zero (currently leading to a crash), since the shape width is user input, so we can\u0027t assume that it\u0027s non-zero. oox::vml::ShapeType::getAbsRectangle() similarly rounds up the width to 1 mm100 if it would be zero, that looks like a reasonable approach to re-use here. What do you think? Thanks.",
