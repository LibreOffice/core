      "message": "This is:\n\n1. Wrong, because gb_Library_use_package only takes two arguments; o3tl_inc is passed as a third argument, therefore it is ignored. the function would have to be changed to gb_Library_use_packages (note the trailing \u0027s\u0027 in the function\u0027s name).\n\n2. Unnecessary, as drawinglayer links with basegfx, which already depends on o3tl_inc (see basegfx/Library_basegfx.mk).\n\nDoes this patch (try to) solve a real build problem?",
