I don\u0027t know if it needs to be the first line of \u0027#if PCH_LEVEL \u003e\u003d 1\u0027 (no idea which headers go there, and looks like those are only standard C++ headers - maybe unaffected by the defines in config.h), but it seems that *at least* it should go before all other our headers?\n\nWhat needs to be changed in bin/update_pch?",
