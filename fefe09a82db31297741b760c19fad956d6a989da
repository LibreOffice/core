      "message": "Always good to have someone double-check your thinking when dealing with compat settings...\n\nIf the ODT doesn\u0027t explicitly have these variables, then there is no need for code to explicitly set it to the default value. I don\u0027t think there is anything special about any of these situations, so likely this is just copy/paste duplication of un-necessity.\n\nOne more patch follows with a same song-different verse situation.",

      "message": "The reason for the change? I was looking at Laurent\u0027s attempt to simplify a template, and he cut out almost all settings.xml content. That got me thinking that this would make an OLD looking file, and some settings SHOULD be included. I was going through this list of variables that \"are not set\" and found these that matched the default settings for no apparent reason.\n\nSo, it would be nice to have a clean list of variables that ought to be set as a minimum for a modern ODT.",
