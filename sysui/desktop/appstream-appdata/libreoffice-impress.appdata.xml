Impress is a presentation program and part of the LibreOffice productivity suite.
Impress is the fastest and easiest way to create effective multimedia presentations.
Stunning animation and sensational special effects help you convince your audience.
Create presentations that look even more professional than the standard
presentations you commonly see at work. Get your colleagues’ and bosses’ attention
by creating something a little bit different.
</p>
<p>
LibreOffice supports opening and saving into a wide variety of formats, so you
can easily share presentations with users of other popular office suites without
worrying about compatibility.
