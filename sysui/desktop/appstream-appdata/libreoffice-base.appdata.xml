    <p>
Base is a powerful database manager, part of the ZetaOffice productivity suite.
It allows you to store, manage and maintain different collections of data.
Base makes it easy to keep track of your finances, customers, invoices, or even
just the contacts in your address book!
</p>
    <p>
For users that are new to databases, Base offers helpful wizards to create tables,
queries, forms and reports.
It's a solution for people requiring an easy-to-understand, simple-to-use system.
</p>
    <p>
For power users and enterprise requirements, it provides native-support drivers
for some of the most-widely employed multi-user database engines:
PostgreSQL, MySQL and MS Access.
In addition, the built-in support for JDBC- and ODBC-standard drivers allows you
to connect to virtually any other existing database engine as well.
