  <description>
    <p>
Writer is the word processor inside ZetaOffice productivity suite.
Use it for everything, from dashing off a quick letter to producing an entire
book with tables of contents, embedded illustrations, bibliographies and diagrams.
The while-you-type auto-completion, auto-formatting and automatic spell-checking
make difficult tasks easy (but are easy to disable if you prefer).
Writer is powerful enough to tackle desktop publishing tasks such as creating
multi-column newsletters and brochures. The only limit is your imagination.
</p>
    <p>
Based on the what-you-see-is-what-you-get principle, Writer allows you to apply
various styles and formatting effects to your document and view the results
immediately.
</p>
    <p>
ZetaOffice supports opening and saving into a wide variety of formats, so you
can easily share documents with users of other popular office suites without
worrying about compatibility.
