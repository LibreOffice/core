It *seems* to me that there\u0027s no actually a safe way to combine different instruction sets in a same \"project\". I don\u0027t know if possibly splitting CPU-specific code into a static library could be safer *at some later stage*? (No idea if linking pre-compiled static library would be OK to guarantee the necessary separation; if not, maybe the only safe way would be separate DLLs?)",
