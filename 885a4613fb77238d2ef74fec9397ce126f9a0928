      "message": "This comment doesn\u0027t make sense. If we kept every piece of code that we change commented out, with additional comment \"fixed bug XXX\", the code would quickly become unreadable. A reference to a bug is needed when you want to describe something not obvious, like why is this processing needed here, which could seem unnecessary; and usually that also requires that you add some explanation aside. In this case, the decision to change below to above is only relevant to commit message - where you will explain why do you do the change itself (and bug # is fine there as part of explanation); in the code, the decision to *show* tip does not need an explanation.",
