 * In order to predefine machine-dependent constants,

 * MACHINE      defines the target cpu (by name)
 * SYSTEM       defines the target operating system
 * COMPILER     defines the target compiler
 *
 *      The above may be #defined as "" if they are not wanted.
 *      They should not be #defined as NULL.
 *
 * LINE_PREFIX  defines the # output line prefix, if not "line"
 *              This should be defined as "" if cpp is to replace
 *              the "standard" C pre-processor.
 *
 * FILE_LOCAL   marks functions which are referenced only in the
 *              file they reside.  Some C compilers allow these
 *              to be marked "static" even though they are referenced
 *              by "extern" statements elsewhere.
 *
 * OK_DOLLAR    Should be set TRUE if $ is a valid alphabetic character
 *              in identifiers (default), or zero if $ is invalid.
 *              Default is TRUE.
 *
 * OK_CONCAT    Should be set TRUE if # may be used to concatenate
 *              tokens in macros (per the Ansi Draft Standard) or
 *              FALSE for old-style # processing (needed if cpp is
 *              to process assembler source code).
 *
 * OK_DATE      Predefines the compilation date if set TRUE.
 *              Not permitted by the Nov. 12, 1984 Draft Standard.
 *
 * S_CHAR etc.  Define the sizeof the basic TARGET machine word types.
 *              By default, sizes are set to the values for the HOST
 *              computer.  If this is inappropriate, see the code in
 *              cpp3.c for details on what to change.  Also, if you
 *              have a machine where sizeof (signed int) differs from
 *              sizeof (unsigned int), you will have to edit code and
 *              tables in cpp3.c (and extend the -S option definition.)
 *
 * CPP_LIBRARY  May be defined if you have a site-specific include directory
 *              which is to be searched *before* the operating-system
 *              specific directories.
