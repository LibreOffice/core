We only need the *_FOR_BUILD value in external/hsqldb/ExternalProject_hsqldb.mk, so I didn\u0027t add the non--*_FOR_BUILD variable itself to config_host.mk.in.  Things appear to already work as intended for non--cross-compiling builds, but there\u0027s most likely further modifications necessary for cross-compiling builds.",
