We only need the *_FOR_BUILD value in external/hsqldb/ExternalProject_hsqldb.mk, so I didn\u0027t add the non--*_FOR_BUILD variable itself to config_host.mk.in.  Things appear to already work as intended for non--cross-compiling builds, but there\u0027s most likely further modifications necessary for cross-compiling builds.",

      "message": "This is missing an entry in DIRECT_FOR_BUILD_SETTINGS, so in case of a cross build the setting from the build / cross-toolset configure run is actually copied as _FOR_BUILD into the config_host.mk.in.\n\nCurrently JDK_SECURITYMANAGER_DISALLOWED_FOR_BUILD is just set in the case of non-cross build, where you copy that value explicitly. There is no JDK_SECURITYMANAGER_DISALLOWED value exported, because the cross-toolset doesn\u0027t need to call any Java tooling, just the host (build).",
