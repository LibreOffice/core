This module exist only to take advantage of the ability of gbuild to build
multiple modules in one single Makefile.

A few module that normally get built at the end of the build process
are already converted. this 'pseudo-module' build them all as one.

As module get converted to gbuild they can be added to this module
if they fix the neceesary pre-requisite. that is:

To qualify a module must not be the dependant of any other module,
except postprocess or if the other module itself is under tail_build

To migrate a module <foo> under tail_build, one should:
* merge the dependencies declared in <foo>/prj/build.lst into tail_build/prj/build.lst
* remove the module <foo> from postprocess/prj/build.lst dependencies
* remove the module <foo> from tail_build/prj/build.lst dependencies
* add the module name in Module_tail_build.mk at the root of bootstrap
