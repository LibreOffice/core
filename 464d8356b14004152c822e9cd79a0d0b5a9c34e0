      "message": "Some notes - feel free to ignore.\n\nAt first I was wondering if we can use xPS because it\u0027s already pointing to the model - but guessing that won\u0027t compile because xPS doesn\u0027t declare the right interface. It would be possible to add a temporary XRerence\u003cXModel\u003e but that\u0027s probably not a reasonable change if we\u0027re just trying to fix the crash.\n\nWhich is also when I realised that we should probably be doing this inside Listener::init which is  where we send slideshow_started. But that\u0027s also beyond the scope of a simple crash fix - so I filed https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d143293 to look into making that change in future. (This will need more testing because I\u0027m not sure how clients actually handle slideshow_info in the first place.)",
