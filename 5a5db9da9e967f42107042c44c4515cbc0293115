      "message": "I wonder if nStart\u003c0 could actually happen, but I\u0027m not sure what the comment \"e.g. searching for $ with ICU regex engine\" really refers to. If nStart can be \u003c0 then surely we need to take care of that and not just assert, which has no effect in a non-debug build. Could you please clarify?",
