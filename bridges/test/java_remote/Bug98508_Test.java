/**
 * Test case for bug #98508#.
 *
 * <p>Bug #98508# "JAVA UNO bridge is not disposed when Exception occurs during
 * sendReply()" states that the server returning <code>null</code> instead of a
 * valid <code>String</code> from <code>XServiceName.getServiceName</code>
 * causes an exception when sending the reply, but this exception did not cause
 * the bridge to be disposed, it rather caused both client and server to
 * hang.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since null instead of a <code>String</code> no longer causes an exception
 * in the bridge, this test has been redesigned to send a value of a wrong
 * instantiated polymorphic struct type instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>This test has to detect whether the spawned client process indeed hangs,
 * which can not be done reliably.  As an approximation, it waits for 10 sec and
 * considers the process hanging if it has not completed by then.</p>
