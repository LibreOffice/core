/**
 * Test case for bug #97697#.
 *
 * <p>Bug #97697# "GPF in java-uno bridge in bugdoc scenario" shows that sending
 * a plain <code>Object</code> as an <code>Any</code> over the URP bridge lead
 * to a <code>StackOverflowError</code> on the writer thread, which was silently
 * discarded (and the bridge was not disposed).</p>
 *
 * <p>This test has to detect whether the spawned client process indeed hangs,
 * which can not be done reliably.  As an approximation, it waits for 10 sec and
 * considers the process hanging if it has not completed by then.</p>
