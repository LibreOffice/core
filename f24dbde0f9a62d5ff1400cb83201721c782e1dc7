      "message": "Thanks for the advise!\n\nThe lok seems to depend on calling the parent method, not the overridden (if I read the failure correctly). It would need to make the StartAction/EndAction themselves virtual, instead of their impls; and that would move the currently inline check if the call is needed into the virtual function, which could impair performance in more places ... so I suppose I should abandon this.",
