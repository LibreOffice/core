Does the search silently continue from the beginning? \n\nI would keep those strings (and even extend them, \u0027reached the end of the document, continuing from the top\u0027), ~all decent text editors have such notifications and this (some label in a dialog appearing) is a very mild form of it. \n\nSome not so decent text editors have the user close a pop-up dialog when the end of the search space is reached.",
