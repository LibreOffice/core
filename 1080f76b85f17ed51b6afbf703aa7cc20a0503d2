      "message": "I love all the comments. Yes there\u0027s a typo here, but at least now the typo is in a comment and not code.\n\nI don\u0027t love the magic numbers for mnDirection. It would be nice if it were a std::bitset\u003c2\u003e or an enum class, or at least using named constants. But I understand this may be beyond the scope of this change, and so yes thanks for adding these comments to reduce confusion.",
