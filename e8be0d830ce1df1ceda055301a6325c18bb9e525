      "message": "Stephan: this is the line that fixes unit tests failing after the changes in the Sequence.h*. It is indeed a hack - and it scares me. It looks like a bug somewhere - as if some code somewhere does *not* do COW when modifying a Sequence, and the write in one Sequence modifies other Sequences pointing to the same uno_Sequence...\n\nI wasn\u0027t able to catch the point where this might happen - do you have an idea how to catch that? Thanks!",
