    ===========================================================================
    ATTENTION! PLEASE! HEADS UP! IMPORTANT!
    ===========================================================================

    Please validate your locale data contribution.

    A quick validation check can be done if you have xmllint installed and the
    current locale.dtd file at hand, you can download the locale.dtd file from
    https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/plain/i18npool/source/localedata/data/locale.dtd

    xmllint --dtdvalid locale.dtd --noout your_data.xml


    Second, using a validating parser. A validating parser, for example, may be found at
    http://unicode.org/cldr/data/tools/java/org/unicode/cldr/util/XMLValidator.java
    Compile it into a class-jar and call it in the
    i18npool/source/localedata/data/ directory:
    java -cp <your_path>/XMLValidator.jar org.unicode.cldr.util.XMLValidator your_data.xml


    A third possibility is:

    - temporarily (!) change the DOCTYPE of your file to read (all on one line)
      <!DOCTYPE Locale SYSTEM "http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/plain/i18npool/source/localedata/data/locale.dtd">

    - upload it to the form available at http://www.validome.org/xml/

    This will validate the file against the HEAD revision of locale.dtd


    Please test locale data files either in an enable-dbgutil build, which
    implements some checks and pops up assertion message boxes if the tests
    fail, or by setting the environment variable OOO_ENABLE_LOCALE_DATA_CHECKS
    to 'Y' or 'Yes' (or any other string starting with 'Y') or '1' before
    starting the application, which outputs the same messages to stderr and
    also works in a product build.

    Then follow this procedure:
    1. Create a new spreadsheet document.
    2. On a cell use context menu -> Format Cells -> Numbers.
    3. Select the locale in the Language list box => MUST be assertion free.
    3.a. Assertions are only shown at the very first time a number formatter
         is created, respectively the first time a specific locale data is
         used.  To repeat steps 1.-3. you'd need to create another spreadsheet
         document.

    ===========================================================================
    NOTE the FormatElement comments further down.

<!--
    The following FormatElements must follow specific rules:

    All:
        The format indices 0..59 are reserved and, for backwards compatibility,
        indices 0..49 MUST be used as stated in
        offapi/com/sun/star/i18n/NumberFormatIndex.idl (
        http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/offapi/com/sun/star/i18n/NumberFormatIndex.idl )
        Note that indices 10 ("# ?/?"), 11 ("# ??/??"), 48 (BOOLEAN) and 49 (@
        Text) are generated internally, as they aren't locale dependent, and
        must not be used in locale data XML files. All other formats have to be
        present.

        Note also that "must be used as stated" does not mean that the format
        codes must be identical, of course the meaning of a format code should
        match, for example en_US MM/DD/YY matches de_DE DD.MM.YY
        Just imagine the same index being used with another locale shouldn't
        change the meaning of representation significantly.

        You'll notice differences of non-matching format codes only if
        documents use the Default language in number formats and either are
        stored in old SO5 binary file format and loaded on another system where
        languages/locales aren't the same, or if the default locale is switched
        under menu Tools.Options.LanguageSettings.Languages.LocaleSetting
        dialog, which exchanges formats on the fly in the spreadsheet
        application. Please check it out! So far only very few locale data file
        we received got that right, especially not in date formats!

        For easier comparison between locales in future please sort the
        FormatElements by their formatindex="..." value within a usage group.
        This isn't necessary to be technically correct and isn't done in many
        locales yet, but will certainly help.

        If you want to define yet more formats than the preset and reserved
        0..49 range that's fine, only make sure those formatindex="..." values
        are each >=60 and all values are unique within one locale.

    Of usage="FIXED_NUMBER":
        formatindex="0" MUST be the format containing the 'General' keyword.
        The keyword itself may be localized, it is good practice though to
        stick with a wording known from another spreadsheet application for
        better user experience. Like other format codes it may be prepended
        with a [NatNum1] modifier if values are to be displayed using native
        numbering if no specific format was applied. The format must have the
        default="true" and type="medium" attributes.

    Of usage="DATE":
        formatindex="21" is used to edit already existing date data. In order
        to always edit the full century the long year YYYY code must be used.
        Furthermore, the format has to be of an editable type, of course, which
        means parseable. Therefore it should only contain DD, MM, YYYY and date
        separators, and the YMD default order is determined from the order
        encountered in this format.
        TODO: Future versions should make use of an edit="true" attribute
        instead of relying on this special requirement.

        formatindex="33" must be ISO 8601 YYYY-MM-DD format code.

    Of usage="DATE_TIME":
        formatindex="47" is used to edit already existing combined date/time
        data. The requirements are the same as for formatindex="21" above.

    Of usage="TIME":
        * The FormatElement with default="true" type="medium" is used to edit
          times and thus must contain all HH and MM and SS codes, e.g. HH:MM:SS
        * Formatindices 43, 44, 45 are special in the sense that they are
          programmatically used to automatically display values that meet
          certain criteria:
          * Formatindex="43" contains the [HH] format code that displays hour
            values greater than or equal to 24 (as opposed to a simple HH that
            displays modulo 24).
          * Formatindex="44" uses no hour code but 100th seconds and the
            Time100SecSeparator.
          * Formatindex="45" uses both [HH] hour code and 100th seconds to be
            able to edit such time values without losing information.

    Of usage="CURRENCY":
        formatindices 12, 13, 14, 15, 17 with [$xxx-yyy] notation must use the
        xxx currency symbol that has the attribute
        usedInCompatibleFormatCodes="true".  The hexadecimal yyy LANGID must be
        properly set. It can be found in the file include/i18nlangtag/lang.h (
        http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/include/i18nlangtag/lang.h )
        You may verify the proper use of the xxx currency symbol with the AWK
        script i18npool/source/localedata/data/currency-check.awk, it mustn't
        display any output. If it does, then there's something wrong.

    Index key for the algorithm and language, like >A-Z< for English => A, B,
    C, ..., Y, Z. The letters specify under which key an entry goes and the
    order the keys are sorted. Keys may be reordered or letters inserted to
    form a specific order, for example (ve_ZA) >A-D Ḓ E-L Ḽ M N Ṋ Ṅ O-T Ṱ U-Z<
    Entries that don't match a defined key are appended to the index list. Used
    in Writer textprocessor.

    The initial data was setup according to the ICU collation chart at
    http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/charts/collation/
    Note: ICU site was moved to http://www.icu-project.org/ and as ICU per

    Possible notations in the syntax of the IndexKey element are:

    '-' (dash): Ellipsis, all letters elided by the ellipsis are included as
    index keys in alphabetic order. For example, 'A-Z' includes all ASCII
    letters A to Z.

    '[]' (square brackets): all letters included in square brackets are
    skipping letters. It is used for CTL languages, for example in Thai
    (th_TH), to skip prefix vowels or signs. For example, if ["] double quote
    is defined as skipping letter, index item '"Index"' will be under 'I', not
    '"'.

    '{}' (curly brackets): define multiple letters index key, for example
    '{Cs}' is one of the index keys for Hungarian (hu_HU).

    '()' (parentheses): define optional description for index key. If defined,
    the description will be shown as index key title, instead of the index key
    itself. For example, 'E(E, É)' in Hungarian adds entries with 'E' to the
    description 'E, É'.

    ``p.'' and ``pp.'', valid data should be provided by native speakers.
    These words or abbreviations are used in the Writer's index table. The
    first FollowPageWord element is the abbreviation for "page" (p.), the
    second FollowPageWord element the abbreviation for "page and following
    pages" (pp.).
