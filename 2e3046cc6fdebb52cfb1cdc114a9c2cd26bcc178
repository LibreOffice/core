      "message": "The original comment was about bootstrap_map::get/release, which needed a mutex to guard access to the m_map member variable of any given instance of bootstrap_map.  The comment was not about the well-known fact how access to a std::unordered_map must be synchronized across threads.  I think it would be better to remove this comment now.",
