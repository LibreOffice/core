      "message": "It looks a bit fishy that while most of those pch files apparently happen to meet the clang-format criteria (and are thus removed from the blacklist), at least this one is not.  All of those files should ideally be fully generated, without manual editing.  So I think we should either ensure that the generation mechanism is guaranteed to generated clang-format\u0027ed output and remove all the pch files from the blacklist, or else keep all of them blacklisted.",
