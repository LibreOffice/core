Do we simply generally discourage any NULL use? (Asking because of curiosity, no problem in this)\n\n[1] https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-certopenstore",

      "message": "The C++ standard mandates that NULL be defined as a null pointer constant, so documentation that suggests to pass NULL to a parameter of integral type (HCRYPTPROV_LEGACY being documented as a typedef of ULONG_PTR, in turn being documented as a typedef of either unsigned __int64 or unsigned long) is doing so in violation of the standard, living in the self-contained world of the standards-violating Windows API.\n\nWhen I prepared this change rather mechanically, I did not bother to check whether any of the existing misuses (per the standard) of NULL were actually sanctioned by that standards-violating Windows API.",
