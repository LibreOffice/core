      "message": "This code block assumes that the type of x and sqlType are consistent. That is, it assumes that if sqlType indicates \"32 bit integer\", then x contains a 32 bit integer.\n\nThe point of this function is rather that the caller does not have to care about this, and the function itself will do the conversion. It can use the utility function ::dbtools::setObjectWithInfo for that, which will usually do the right thing. Among the drivers, many implementations of setObjectWithInfo are of the form:\n\nif(some special case to be handled specifically)\n{\n   do stuff\n}\nelse\n{\n   ::dbtools::setObjectWithInfo(this,parameterIndex,x,sqlType,scale)\n}",

Is it ever appropriate not to pass a subtype to this function? Maybe it is, you tell me. In that case, maybe the default value is a good idea. But please explain.",

      "message": "I understand. My opinion is that it is better to force the caller of getColumnTypeFromFBType to explicitly put the 0 so that he says that in this call, it is impossible to have a BLOB, DECIMAL or NUMERIC, rather than assuming that by default. It leads to less programming errors. However, this is a matter of opinion and I don\u0027t formally oppose your choice.\n\nDon\u0027t we need to handle subtypes also in getColumnTypeFromFBType ?",
