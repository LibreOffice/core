      "message": "Seems the default Color constructor initializes Alpha to zero - so (hopefully) unless touched this it is touched will behave as before. This removes the \u0027lok\u0027 hack in there, and - I hope makes things more consistent.\n\nThoughts ? - also (I guess) we need the RTL work forward porting to master too.\n",
