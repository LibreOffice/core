      "message": "This existing label fit the purpose I wanted, but I don\u0027t know if Table Design has a more limited meaning.  At this point I just hijacked it for convenience, and at least in English it seems to fit well.  The real use seems to be more limited to applying table styles though?\n\nI was also wondering whether it would be good or bad to disable the submenu if there was no table selected. Doing so would involve creating a SID_ for it I think. But likely disabling a submenu is not really a good idea...",
