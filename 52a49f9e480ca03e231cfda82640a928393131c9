I imagined that we could use a private default ctor used in the public ctors, which would include those asserts, thus testing it for the instantiated type ... I realize that it doesn\u0027t matter in practice, just curious if that was possible in theory - or would having these static asserts in non-static member function (ctor) fail?",
