      "message": "Could you please document this assertion? I mean, the ideal wording is something like:\n\n // Without the accompanying fix in place, this test would have failed with:\n // - Expected ...\n // - Actual ...\n // i.e. the point was rendered on the right side of the vertical line, not on the left side.\n\nOr similar. You get the idea: by the time the test fails, it should be obvious if you got the failure mode that was the old bug or you have a state that is neither the old bad behavior nor the new good one.\n\nWithout this, it\u0027s not easy to manually verify the patch, either.",
