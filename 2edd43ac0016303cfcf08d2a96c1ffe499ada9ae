      "message": "Why could this be necessary? If the object is just initialized, its ctor has already set it to nullptrs. If ImplReleaseTempFonts(..., true) was called from WinSalGraphics::ClearDevFontCache(), they are also already nullptrs. IIUC non-nullptrs here are some programmer\u0027s error that needs fixing in proper place - I suggest asserting here.",

ImplInitSalGDI is just called at the end of create_SalInstance, which will just be called once, ever, as it\u0027s the VCL plugin entry point. I guess the SalData init is split because of some Windows setup needed to get GDI working.",
