      "message": "There will still need to be a const / non-const version of GetSectionInfo since most \"get flag\" functions that will be calling this are const, and \"set flag\" cannot be const.\n\nSo I have been trying to use the same basic design between SectionInfo and ParaInfo. Ensuring a sectionInfo via the CTOR might work for Sections, but it won\u0027t work for Paragraphs - since at least in RTF you can EndParagraph without a StartParagraph - and that could eventually try to pop/query an empty stack.  (Of course, every instance that does that could be considered a bug that needs to be fixed, but I don\u0027t necessarily want to be the guy that has to fix all the complicated, pre-existing problems.)\n\nRTF import is pretty easy to make a malicious document I think, so I\u0027m trying to make this somewhat bullet-proof as a reference. The alternative is to always use \"Get/Set flag\" functions and in them verify the stack is not empty. If using a static variable is terrible design, I guess I would have to do that instead.",
