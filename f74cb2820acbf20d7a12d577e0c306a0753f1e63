      "message": "that doesn\u0027t look quite right, the first 3 return false are for cases where moving isn\u0027t allowed.\n\nso false means either moved to a different page (if returned at the end), or not moved at all;\ntrue means moved but still on the same page (could be columns or linked frames perhaps? or the follow is actually on the same page currently).",

      "message": "Oh, I think I know why you used \"should\" here. Because of the note that the moving must be implemented in a subclass.  Yet, it is still the function MoveBwd that is causing the change to the page, so the return is not a \"should\" but a \"did\", right?",

      "message": "\"different\": I left this ambiguous, because sometimes it can move back multiple (presumably completely empty) pages. But should it be more clear that it was moved to an \"earlier\" page? I assume it always moves backwards.\n\nAlthough that seems to be a bit of a nebulous concept. If moving back is going to an earlier page, and going forward is going to a new page, where am I in the middle?  Nowhere I presume, and perhaps that explains a bit of my confusion about this whole layout thing. So from a \"MovedFwd\" standpoint, if you haven\u0027t MovedFwd, you have by definition MovedBwd? And from a \"MovedBwd\" viewpoint, if I can\u0027t MoveBwd, then by definition I have MovedFwd?",
