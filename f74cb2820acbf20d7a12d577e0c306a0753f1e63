      "message": "\"different\": I left this ambiguous, because sometimes it can move back multiple (presumably completely empty) pages. But should it be more clear that it was moved to an \"earlier\" page? I assume it always moves backwards.\n\nAlthough that seems to be a bit of a nebulous concept. If moving back is going to an earlier page, and going forward is going to a new page, where am I in the middle?  Nowhere I presume, and perhaps that explains a bit of my confusion about this whole layout thing. So from a \"MovedFwd\" standpoint, if you haven\u0027t MovedFwd, you have by definition MovedBwd? And from a \"MovedBwd\" viewpoint, if I can\u0027t MoveBwd, then by definition I have MovedFwd?",
