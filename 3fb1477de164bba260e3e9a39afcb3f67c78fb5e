      "message": "Just a note: I suppose that ECMA vs ISO is not about \"OOXML vs MS implementation\" (the latter has its own documentation, like [MS-DOCX] and the like). It\u0027s rather about the standards organization that *governs* the standard evolution (ECMA), as opposed to the ISO that gets the prepared standard basically ready to the final standardization. Absolutely similar to OASIS ODF vs ISO ODF.",
