      "message": "Just a note: I suppose that ECMA vs ISO is not about \"OOXML vs MS implementation\" (the latter has its own documentation, like [MS-DOCX] and the like). It\u0027s rather about the standards organization that *governs* the standard evolution (ECMA), as opposed to the ISO that gets the prepared standard basically ready to the final standardization. Absolutely similar to OASIS ODF vs ISO ODF.",

      "message": "Note that now, not only we have the \"Transitional\" label in export dialog, but also in import dialog; this makes me confused: is that really correct? Given the explanation:\n\n\u003e We have 3 filters:\n\u003e strict: this is import-only\n\n... it *seems* to me that our \"strict\" import filter is likely a sub-filter of one or the other IMPORT/EXPORT DOCX filters; so on import, the \"transitional\" label looks too restrictive (it appears because it\u0027s the same filter, and it indeed has only one name).\n\nWould it be reasonable to clutter the name more to add something like \"(Transitional on export)\"?",
