It seems like enums are not consistently used in this property, and I was a little surprised to see that sal_Int16/32 rejected an enum during Any \u003e\u003e\u003d sal_Int.\n\nSo far I have failed to find all the places where these non-enums are being entered (somewhere in table properties). I think my task for today is hunting that down.",
