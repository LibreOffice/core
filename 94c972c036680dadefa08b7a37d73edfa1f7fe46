      "message": "This is OK, but with the test you actually want to measure the speed of B2DPolygon drawing, so the problem with that now is that we do all kind of caching of Wavelines in call to DrawWaveline, so it doesn\u0027t actually measure B2DPolygon drawing because of it.\n\nSo you probably need to prepare and draw the waveline manually:\nYou can create a waveline polygon easily with:\nconst basegfx::B2DPolygon aWaveLinePolygon \u003d basegfx::createWaveLinePolygon(aWaveLineRectangle);\nwhere the rectangle is the are where to draw it (same as mpVirtualDevice-\u003eDrawWaveLine)\nThen draw with DrawPolyLine call",
