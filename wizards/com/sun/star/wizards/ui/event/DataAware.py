DataAware objects are used to live-synchronize UI and DataModel/DataObject.
It is used as listener on UI events, to keep the DataObject up to date.
This class, as a base abstract class, sets a frame of functionality,
delegating the data Object get/set methods to a Value object,
and leaving the UI get/set methods abstract.
Note that event listenning is *not* a part of this model.
the updateData() or updateUI() methods should be porogramatically called.
in child classes, the updateData() will be binded to UI event calls.
<br><br>
This class holds references to a Data Object and a Value object.
The Value object "knows" how to get and set a value from the
Data Object.
