      "message": "So, in practice, using unordered_map would only be relevant for cppuhelper::ServiceManager::Data::services?  And do you happen to have any performance numbers?  (But yeah, this mostly comes from a time when std::map was just the standard thing to use in C++, and the code likely does not actually rely on std::map vs. std::unordered_map.)",

      "message": "I have one document where text layout results in calls to GenericSalLayout::SetNeedFallback(), which triggers this while creating a BreakIterator. Doing the change reduced the cost while laying out the document from 3% to \u003c1%. Admittedly this is also because layout caching fails in this case, so the layout is called way too often, and it won\u0027t be as much after I fix that, but it still seemed like a good change to do.",
