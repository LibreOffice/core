      "message": "Both Calc and Excel *appear* to use whichever one comes first in the column i.e. if \u0027A\u0027 happens first before \u0027a\u0027, that becomes the dominant value of the two.  Now, I would think that this is a \"sort of\" expected behavior since it appears to consistently work that way across the board, again both in Calc and Excel.",
