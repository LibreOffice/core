The number format dialog is shown on tables, to get it you can follow these steps\n- Insert a table\n- Click on any of the cells\n- Enter the table section of the ribbon\n- Click on number format\n\nYou may want to have a number in the cell so that you can see how it changes after formatting it",

(.ui is simple xml, you can compare with some working dialog)",

If so should I pursue searching for the issue in online-side where I believe our builders are?",
