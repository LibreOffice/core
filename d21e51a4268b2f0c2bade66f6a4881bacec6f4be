      "message": "This does not work as expected. There are two possible ways to fix it:\n\n1. use share/config/wizard/form/styles as destination dir\n\n2. use gb_Package_add_files_with_dir, which does not strip dirs from the source files when constructing destination paths. See the documentation in solenv/gbuild/Package.mk (our gbuild classes--at least the commonly used ones--are quite nicely documented, which is one of the differences between gbuild and the old build system).",
