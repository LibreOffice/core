    /** Holds a uno::Reference alongside a C++ implementation pointer

        This template is useful to accomplish the following task: the
        client needs an implementation pointer to an object providing
        UNO interfaces. It is unsafe to simply store a C++ pointer,
        because of the automatic UNO lifetime control. It is
        inconvenient to always cast the UNO interface to the C++
        implementation, and what's more, it's mostly unclear to the
        casual code reader.

        Thus, this template nicely encapsulate the stated intention,
        by holding a uno::Reference internally, and providing simple
        C++ pointer semantics to the outside. As a differentiator to
        ::rtl::Reference, this template features a getRef() method,
        giving you friction-less access to the internal UNO interface,
        without extra querying.

        By the way, the pointer semantic of this template include
        transitive constness. That means, if this template's instance
        is const (e.g. because it is a member of a class which is
        accessed in a const method), the pointer returned is also
        const.

        As this template is geared towards fast, internal pointer
        access, validity of the UNO reference is _not_ checked for
        every pointer access. The client of this template is
        responsible to check that, whereever necessary, via the is()
        method.

        @tpl CppType
        The C++ type this class should mimick a pointer to (not the
        pointer type itself!).

        @tpl UnoType
        The UNO interface type of the object (a uno::Reference to this
        type is held internally).

        @tpl XIfType
        An unambiguous derivative of UnoType. This is defaulted to
        the second template parameter (UnoType), which should normally
        just work, since one typically has only single inheritance in
        UNO.<p>
        Alternatively, when using the
        ImplementationReference::createFromQuery() method to create an
        instance, this type can serve a different need: if the
        provided CppType only derives from XInterface (generally
        speaking, derives from a UNO interface above UnoType in the
        class hierarchy), then the default XIfType constitutes a
        possibly invalid downcast to UnoType. Setting XIfType equal to
        CppTypes's most derived UNO interface type then solves this
        problem (which is not as arcane as it seems to be. Just
        imagine you're providing a C++ abstract interface, which must
        provide UNO reference semantics. Naturally, you will derive
        this C++ interface only from XInterface, to reduce the number
        of ambiguous classes. Even more naturally, it is reasonable to
        have UnoType be something different from XInterface, governed
        by the usage of the C++ interface)

            This constructor does not perform an explicit
            QueryInterface on the provided implementation object, but
            constructs the UNO reference directly from the given
            pointer. This is the fastest, and most often the best way
            to create an ImplementationReference. If the conversion
            between the implementation object and the required UNO
            interface is ambiguous, provide the third template
            parameter with a type that can be unambiguously upcasted
            to the UNO interface (the second template parameter).

            There are cases, however, where performing a
            QueryInterface is the better, albeit slower choice. In
            these cases, createFromQuery() should be used.
