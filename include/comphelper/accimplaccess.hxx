    /** This is a helper class which allows accessing several aspects of the implementation
        of an AccessibleContext.

        <p>For instance, when you want to implement a context which can be re-parented, you:
            <ul><li>derive your class from OAccessibleImplementationAccess</li>
                <li>use <code>setAccessibleParent( <em>component</em>, <em>new_parent</em> )</code>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Another aspect which can be controlled from the outside are states. If you have a class which
        has only partial control over it's states, you may consider deriving from OAccessibleImplementationAccess.<br/>
        For instance, say you have an implementation (say component A) which is <em>unable</em> to know or to
        determine if the represented object is selected, but another component (say B) which uses A (and integrates
        it into a tree of accessibility components) is.<br/>
        In this case, if A is derived from OAccessibleImplementationAccess, B can manipulate this
        foreign-controlled state flag "SELECTED" by using the static helper methods on this class.</p>

        <p>Please note that the support for foreign controlled states is rather restrictive: You can't have states
        which <em>may be</em> controlled by a foreign instances. This is implied by the fact that a derived
        class can ask for states which are <em>set</em> only, not for the ones which are <em>reset</em> currently.
