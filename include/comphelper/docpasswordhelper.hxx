        needed by import filters for external file formats that have to check a
        predefined password in some cases without asking the user for a
        password. Every password is checked using the passed password verifier.

        If not successful, the passed password of a medium is tried, that has
        been set e.g. by an API call to load a document. If existing, the
        password is checked using the passed password verifier.

        If still not successful, the passed interaction handler is used to
        request a password from the user. This will be repeated until the
        passed password verifier validates the entered password, or if the user
        chooses to cancel password input.

        @param rVerifier
            The password verifier used to check every processed password.

        @param rMediaPassword
            If not empty, will be passed to the password validator before
            requesting a password from the user. This password usually should
            be querried from a media descriptor.

        @param rxInteractHandler
            The interaction handler that will be used to request a password
            from the user, e.g. by showing a password input dialog.

        @param rDocumentUrl
            The URL of the related document that will be shown in the password
            input dialog.

        @param eRequestType
            The password request type that will be passed to the
            DocPasswordRequest object created internally. See
            docpasswordrequest.hxx for more details.

        @param pDefaultPasswords
            If not null, contains default passwords that will be tried before a
            password will be requested from the media descriptor or the user.

        @param pbIsDefaultPassword
            (output parameter) If not null, the type of the found password will
            be returned. True means the password has been found in the passed
            list of default passwords. False means the password has been taken
            from the rMediaPassword parameter or has been entered by the user.

        @return
            If not empty, contains the password that has been validated by the
            passed password verifier. If empty, no valid password has been
            found, or the user has chossen to cancel password input.
