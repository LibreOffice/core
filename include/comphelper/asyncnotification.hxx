    /** a helper class for notifying events asynchronously

        If you need to notify certain events to external components, you usually should
        not do this while you have mutexes locked, to prevent multi-threading issues.

        However, you do not always have complete control over all mutex guards on the stack.
        If, in such a case, the listener notification is one-way, you can decide to do it
        asynchronously.

        The ->AsyncEventNotifier helps you to process such events asynchronously. Every
        event is tied to an ->IEventProcessor which is responsible for processing it.

        The AsyncEventNotifier is implemented as a thread itself, which sleeps as long as there are no
        events in the queue. As soon as you add an event, the thread is woken up, processes the event,
        and sleeps again.

            from the notification thread itself, then it will block until the notification thread
            finished processing the current event. If you call it from the notification thread
            itself, it will return immediately, and the thread will be terminated as soon as
            the current notification is finished.
