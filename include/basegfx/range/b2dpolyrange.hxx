        This class combines multiple ranges in one object, providing a
        total, enclosing range for it.

        You can use this class e.g. when updating views containing
        rectangular objects. Add each modified object to a
        B2DMultiRange, then test each viewable object against
        intersection with the multi range.

        Similar in spirit to the poly-polygon vs. polygon relationship.

        Note that comparable to polygons, a poly-range can also
        contain 'holes' - this is encoded via polygon orientation at
        the poly-polygon, and via explicit flags for the poly-range.
