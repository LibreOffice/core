            sub-polygons are implicitly handled, but to not lose the

            self-intersections of the contained sub-polygons in a

            Works only correct with self-intersection-free
            polygons. For each polygon, the depth for the PolyPolygon
            is calculated. The orientation is used to identify holes.
            Start value for holes is -1, for polygons it's zero. Ech
            time a polygon is contained in another one, it's depth is
            increased when inside a polygon, decreased when inside a
            hole. The result is a depth which e.g. is -1 for holes
            outside everything, 1 for a polygon covered by another
            polygon and zero for e.g. holes in a polygon or polygons
            outside everything else.  In the 2nd step, all polygons
            with depth other than zero are removed. If bKeepAboveZero
            is used, all polygons < 1 are removed. The bKeepAboveZero
            mode is useful for clipping, e.g. just append one polygon
            to another and use this mode -> only parts where two
            polygons overlapped will be kept.  In combination with
            correct orientation of the input orientations and the
            SolveCrossover calls this can be combined for logical
            polygon operations or polygon clipping.
