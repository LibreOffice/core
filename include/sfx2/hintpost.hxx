/*  [Description]

    With instances of this class unique events per PostUserEvent can be sent
    using the StarView-application. If the User-Event is triggered often,
    the handler <Event()> is called, the base implementation with the
    <SetEventHdl()> line is making these link calls.

    The instance are held via Ref-Count at least as long as a possible sent
    event has not arrived yet. Should be killed before the goal, before the
    connection is SetEventHdl (GenLink ()) .
