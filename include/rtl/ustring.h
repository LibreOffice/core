    The given string is interpreted as a sequence of zero or more UTF-16 code
    units.  For each index into this sequence (from zero to one less than the
    length of the sequence, inclusive), a code point represented starting at the
    given index is computed as follows:

    - If the UTF-16 code unit addressed by the index constitutes a well-formed
    UTF-16 code unit sequence, the computed code point is the scalar value
    encoded by that UTF-16 code unit sequence.

    - Otherwise, if the index is at least two UTF-16 code units away from the
    end of the sequence, and the sequence of two UTF-16 code units addressed by
    the index constitutes a well-formed UTF-16 code unit sequence, the computed
    code point is the scalar value encoded by that UTF-16 code unit sequence.

    - Otherwise, the computed code point is the UTF-16 code unit addressed by
    the index.  (This last case catches unmatched surrogates as well as indices
    pointing into the middle of surrogate pairs.)

    @param string
    pointer to a valid string; must not be null.

    @param indexUtf16
    pointer to a UTF-16 based index into the given string; must not be null.  On
    entry, the index must be in the range from zero to the length of the string
    (in UTF-16 code units), inclusive.  Upon successful return, the index will
    be updated to address the UTF-16 code unit that is the given
    incrementCodePoints away from the initial index.

    @param incrementCodePoints
    the number of code points to move the given *indexUtf16.  If non-negative,
    moving is done after determining the code point at the index.  If negative,
    moving is done before determining the code point at the (then updated)
    index.  The value must be such that the resulting UTF-16 based index is in

    is represented within the string starting at the index computed as follows:
    If incrementCodePoints is non-negative, the index is the initial value of
    *indexUtf16; if incrementCodePoints is negative, the index is the updated
    value of *indexUtf16.  In either case, the computed index must be in the
    range from zero to one less than the length of the string (in UTF-16 code
    units), inclusive.

    An out parameter receiving the converted string.  Must not be null itself,
    and must contain either null or a pointer to a valid rtl_uString; the
    contents are unspecified if conversion fails (rtl_convertStringToUString
    returns false).

    @param source
    The byte string.  May only be null if length is zero.

    @param length
    The length of the byte string.  Must be non-negative.

    @param encoding
    The text encoding to convert from.  Must be an octet encoding (i.e.,
    rtl_isOctetTextEncoding(encoding) must return true).

    @param flags
    A combination of RTL_TEXTTOUNICODE_FLAGS that detail how to do the
    conversion (see rtl_convertTextToUnicode).  RTL_TEXTTOUNICODE_FLAGS_FLUSH
    need not be included, it is implicitly assumed.  Typical uses are either
    RTL_TEXTTOUNICODE_FLAGS_UNDEFINED_ERROR |
    RTL_TEXTTOUNICODE_FLAGS_MBUNDEFINED_ERROR |
    RTL_TEXTTOUNICODE_FLAGS_INVALID_ERROR (fail if a byte or multi-byte sequence
    cannot be converted from the source encoding) or
    OSTRING_TO_OUSTRING_CVTFLAGS (make a best efforts conversion).

    @return
    True if the conversion succeeded, false otherwise.
