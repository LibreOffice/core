/**
    The class TempFile gives access to temporary files in the local file system. Sometimes they are needed because a 3rd party
    code has a file name based interface, or some file access has to be done locally without transferring tons of bytes to or
    from a remote system.
    Creating a UCB content on a TempFile is only possible if a UCP for the local file system is present.
    TempFiles can always be accessed by SvFileStreams or Sot/SvStorages using the "physical" file name ( not the URL, because
    this may be a non-file URL, see below ), but if a UCB content can be created, it is also possible to take the URL and use
    the UCB helper classes for streams. For convenience use UcbStreamHelper.
    A Tempfile always has a "physical" file name ( a file name in the local computers host notation ) but it has a
    "UCB compatible" URL only if a UCP for the local file system exists. This URL may have its own URL scheme
    ( not necessarily "file://" ! ). The TempFile class methods take this into account, but other simple conversions like
    the osl functions do not.
    So it is a potential error to convert between the filename and the URL of a TempFile object using functions or methods
    outside this class.
