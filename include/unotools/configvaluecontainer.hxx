    /** allows simple access to static configuration structures.

        <p>The basic idea of this class is that it's clients (usually derived classes) simply register an
        address in memory and a node path, and upon explicit request, the configuration value and the memory
        are synchronized.<br/>
        This means that when calling <method>read</method>, the current configuration values are copied into
        the memory registered for them, and upon calling <method>write</method> the current values in memory
        are set in the configuration nodes.</p>

        <p>This way, the usage of this class is pretty straight forward: derive your own class, spend some members
        to it, and bind these members to configuration node (usually done in the ctor of the derived class).<br/>
        In the dtor, simply call <method>write</method> and <method>commit</method>.</p>

        <p>There is no auto-commit mechanism in the dtor: In the usual scenario, when you derive from this class
        and bind some members of your derived class to config nodes, this means that your members will be destroyed
        before your base class' dtor is called, so accessing the memory during such a theoretical auto-commit would
        yield undefined behaviour.</p>
