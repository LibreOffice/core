/** Use this function to get the dynamic type of a caught C++-UNO exception;
    completes the above function throwing exceptions generically.

    @code
    try
    {
        ...
    }
    catch (css::uno::RuntimeException &)
    {
        // you ought not handle RuntimeExceptions:
        throw;

    {
        css::uno::Any caught( ::cppu::getCaughtException() );
        ...
    }
    @endcode

    Restrictions:
    - use only for caught C++-UNO exceptions (UNOIDL defined)
    - only as first statement in a catch block!
    - don't do a C++ rethrow (throw;) after you have called this function
    - call getCaughtException() just once in your catch block!
      (function internally uses a C++ rethrow)

    @return
              caught UNO exception

    @attention Caution!
              This function is limited to the same C++ compiler runtime library.
              E.g. for MSVC, this means that the catch handler code (the one
              that calls getCaughtException()) needs to use the very same
              C++ runtime library, e.g. msvcrt.dll as cppuhelper, e.g.
              cppuhelper3MSC.dll and the bridge library, e.g. msci_uno.dll.
              This is the case if all of them are compiled with the same
              compiler version.
              Background: The msci_uno.dll gets a rethrown exception out
              of the internal msvcrt.dll thread local storage (tls).
              Thus you _must_ not use this function if your code needs to run
              in newer UDK versions without being recompiled, because those
              newer UDK (-> OOo versions) potentially use newer C++ runtime
              libraries which most often become incompatible!

              But this function ought to be usable for most OOo internal C++-UNO
              development, because the whole OOo code base is compiled using the
              same C++ compiler (and linking against one runtime library).
