/* This header makes available replacements working in both C and C++ for the
   obsolete osl/diagnose.h functionality that in turn is used from both C and
   C++ code and the obsolete tools/debug.hxx and
   canvas/inc/canvas/verbosetrace.hxx functionality that uses printf-style
   formatting.  Once that obsolete functionality is removed, this header can be
   removed, too.

   This header uses variadic macros in both C (where they are officially only
   supported since C99) and C++ (where they are officially only supported since
   C++11).  It appears that all relevant compilers (esp. GCC 4.0 and MS VS 2008
   Express) already support them in their C and C++ dialects.  See also
   <http://wiki.apache.org/stdcxx/C++0xCompilerSupport>.

   Avoid the use of other sal code in this header as much as possible, so that
   this code can be called from other sal code without causing endless
   recursion.
