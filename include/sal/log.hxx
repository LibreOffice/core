/**
    @page sal_log Basic logging functionality.

    @short Macros for logging.

    SAL_INFO(char const * area, expr),
    SAL_INFO_IF(bool condition, char const * area, expr),
    SAL_WARN(char const * area, expr),
    SAL_WARN_IF(bool condition, char const * area, expr), and SAL_DEBUG(expr)
    produce an info, warning, or debug log entry with a message produced by
    piping items into a C++ std::ostringstream.  The given expr must be so that
    the full expression "stream << expr" is valid, where stream is a variable of
    type std::ostringstream.

      SAL_INFO("foo", "string " << s << " of length " << n)

    would be an example of such a call.

    The composed message should be in UTF-8 and it should contain no vertical
    formatting characters and no null characters

    For the _IF variants, log output is only generated if the given condition is
    true (in addition to the other conditions that have to be met).

    The SAL_DEBUG macro is for temporary debug statements that are used while
    working on code.  It is never meant to remain in the code.  It will always
    simply output the given expression in debug builds.

    For all the other macros, the given area argument must be non-null and must
    match the regular expression

    @verbatim
      <area> ::= <segment>("."<segment>)*
    @endverbatim

    with

    @verbatim
      <segment> ::= [0-9a-z]+
    @endverbatim

    For a list of areas used see @ref sal_log_areas "SAL debug areas". Whenever
    you use a new log area, add it to the file include/sal/log-areas.dox .

    Whether these macros generate any log output is controlled in a two-stage
    process.

    First, at compile time the macros SAL_LOG_INFO and SAL_LOG_WARN,
    respectively, control whether the INFO and WARN macros, respectively,
    expand to actual code (in case the macro is defined, to any value) or to
    no-ops (in case the macro is not defined).

    Second, at runtime the environment variable SAL_LOG further limits which
    macro calls actually generate log output.  The environment variable SAL_LOG
    must either be unset or must match the regular expression

    @verbatim
      <env> ::= <switch>*
    @endverbatim

    with

    @verbatim
      <switch> ::= <sense><item>
      <sense> ::= "+"|"-"
      <item> ::= <flag>|<level>("."<area>)?
      <flag> ::= "TIMESTAMP"|"RELATIVETIMER"|"FATAL"
      <level> ::= "INFO"|"WARN"
    @endverbatim

    If the environment variable is unset, the setting "+WARN" is
    assumed instead (which results in all warnings being output but no
    infos).  If the given value does not match the regular expression,
    "+INFO+WARN" is used instead (which in turn results in everything
    being output).

    The "+TIMESTAMP" flag causes each output line (as selected by the level
    switch(es)) to be prefixed by a timestamp like 2016-08-18:14:04:43.

    The "+RELATIVETIMER" flag causes each output line (as selected by
    the level switch(es)) to be prefixed by a relative timestamp in
    seconds since the first output line like 1.312.

    The "+FATAL" flag will cause later matching rules to log and call
    std::abort. This can be disabled at some later point by using the
    "-FATAL" flag before specifying additional rules. The flag will just
    abort on positive rules, as it doesn't seem to make sense to abort
    on ignored output.

    If both +TIMESTAMP and +RELATIVETIMER are specified, they are
    output in that order.

    Specifying a flag with a negative sense has no effect. Specifying
    the same flag multiple times has no extra effect.

    A given macro call's level (INFO or WARN) and area is matched against the
    given switches as follows:  Only those switches for which the level matches
    the given level and for which the area is a prefix (including both empty and
    full prefixes) of the given area are considered.  Log output is generated if
    and only if among the longest such switches (if any), there is at least one
    that has a sense of "+".  (That is, if both +INFO.foo and -INFO.foo are
    present, +INFO.foo wins.)

    If no WARN selection is specified, but an INFO selection is, the
    INFO selection is used for WARN messages, too.

    For example, if SAL_LOG is "+INFO-INFO.foo+INFO.foo.bar", then calls like
    SAL_INFO("foo.bar", ...), SAL_INFO("foo.bar.baz", ...), or
    SAL_INFO("other", ...) generate output, while calls like
    SAL_INFO("foo", ...) or SAL_INFO("foo.barzzz", ...) do not.

    The generated log output consists of the optional timestamp, the given level
    ("info" or "warn"), the given area, the process ID, the thread ID, the
    source file, and the source line number, each followed by a colon, followed
    by a space, the given message, and a newline.  The precise format of the log
    output is subject to change.  The log output is printed to stderr without
    further text encoding conversion.

    On some systems, log output can be redirected to other log sinks,
    notably a file provided as a system path and filename via
    environment variable SAL_LOG_FILE; or to a syslog facility if
    LibreOffice is suitably built, by setting environment variable
    SAL_LOG_SYSLOG.
