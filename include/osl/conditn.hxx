    /** Condition variable

       A condition variable is essentially an object that is initially
       cleared which a thread waits on until it is "set". It allows a
       thread to synchronize execution by allowing other threads to wait
       for the condition to change before that thread then continues
       execution.

       @deprecated use C++11's std::condition_variable instead
            for a more robust and helpful condition.

       @attention Warning: the Condition abstraction is inadequate for
            any situation where there may be multiple threads setting,
            waiting, and resetting the same condition. It can only be
            used to synchronise interactions between two threads
            cf. lost wakeups in http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/win32-cv-1.html
