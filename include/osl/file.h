Main goals and usage hints

The main intention of this interface is to provide an universal portable and
high performance access to file system functionality on any operating
system.

There are a few main goals:

1. The path specifications always has to be absolute. Any usage of relative
path specifications is forbidden. Exceptions are osl_getSystemPathFromFileURL,
osl_getFileURLFromSystemPath and osl_getAbsoluteFileURL. Most operating
systems provide a "Current Directory" per process. This is the reason why
relative path specifications can cause problems in multithreading
environments.

2. Proprietary notations of file paths are not supported. Every path notation
must the file URL specification. File URLs must be encoded in UTF8 and after
that escaped. Although the URL parameter is a unicode string, the must
contain only ASCII characters.

3. The caller cannot get any information whether a file system is case
sensitive, case preserving or not. The operating system implementation
itself should determine if it can map case-insensitive paths. The case
correct notation of a filename or file path is part of the "File Info". This
case correct name can be used as a unique key if necessary.

4. Obtaining information about files or volumes is controlled by a bitmask
which specifies which fields are of interest. Due to performance reasons it
is not recommended to obtain information which is not needed.  But if the
operating system provides more information anyway the implementation can set
more fields on output as were requested. It is in the responsibility of the
caller to decide if they use this additional information or not. But they
should do so to prevent further unnecessary calls if the information is
already there.

The input bitmask supports a flag osl_FileStatus_Mask_Validate which can be
used to force retrieving uncached validated information. Setting this flag
when calling osl_getFileStatus in combination with no other flag is a synonym
for a "FileExists". This should only be done when processing a single file
(i.e. before opening) and NEVER during enumeration of directory contents on
any step of information processing. This would change the runtime behaviour
from O(n) to O(n*n/2) on nearly every file system.  On Windows NT reading the
contents of an directory with 7000 entries and getting full information about
every file only takes 0.6 seconds. Specifying the flag
osl_FileStatus_Mask_Validate for each entry will increase the time to 180
seconds (!!!).
