/** Reads simple record from a stream
 *
 * An instance of this class allows to read a simple record from a stream that was written by
 * SfxMiniRecordWriter. It is also possible to skip a record, even without knowing its internal
 * format.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @code
 * {
 *      SfxMiniRecordReader aRecord( pStream );
 *      switch ( aRecord.GetTag() )
 *      {
 *          case MY_TAG_X:
 *              *aRecord >> aMember1;
 *              *aRecord >> aMember2;
 *              break;
 *
 *          ...
 *      }
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @par General file format
 *
 *  Each record begins with one byte, the so called 'Pre-Tag'.
 *
 *  If this 'Pre-Tag' == 0x00, then the record is a extended record,
 *  whose type is further determined by another byte at position 5:
 *
 *      0x01:       SfxSingleRecord
 *      0x02:       SfxMultiFixRecord
 *      0x03+0x04:  SfxMultiVarRecord
 *      0x07+0x08:  SfxMultiMixRecord
 *      (All other possible record types are reserved.)
 *
 *  Normally, if only for performance reasons, the file formats are
 *  constructed in such a way, that when loading the record type
 *  is predetermined. So the record type serves mainly for checks
 *  and for file viewers that do not know the exact file format.
 *
 *  For that purpose 'SfxMiniRecordReader' provides a static method
 *  'ScanRecordType()', with which it is possible to find out what
 *  Record type can be found in the stream that was passed.
 *
 *  A 'Pre-Tag' with value 0xFF is reserved for a terminator.
 *  Terminators are used to stop looking for a particular record,
 *  i.e. if it was not found until then the search will not be continued.
 *
 *  For all other values of the 'Pre-Tag' (so 0x01 to 0xFE) the record
 *  is one that is compatible with SW3, called 'SfxMiniRecord' here,
 *  and therefore it can be read with an <SfxMiniRecordReader>.
 *
 *  If the record starts with 0x44 it could be a Drawing-Engine-Record.
 *  This is the case if the following 3 bytes spell 'RMD' or 'RVW'
 *  (which together with  'D'==0x44 form an abbreviation for 'DRaw-MoDel'
 *  or 'DRaw-VieW'). Records of this type cannot be read by the classes
 *  represented here, nor interpreted in any way. Only the
 *  'ScanRecordType()' method can recognise it - but further processing
 *  is impossible.
 *
 *  The 3 bytes in position 2 to 4 normally contain the size of the
 *  record without the pre-tag and the size field itself,
 *  so the remaining size after the 4 byte header.
 *
 *  Structure of the Mini-Records:
 *
 *                           1 sal_uInt8         Pre-Tag
 *                           3 sal_uInt8         OffsetToEndOfRec
 *       OffsetToEndOfRec*   1 sal_uInt8         Content
 *
 *  For Extended-Records the 4 byte header is followed by an extended header,
 *  which contains first the record type, than a version number
 *  and a tag, which indicates the kind of content.
 *
 *  Structure of the extended record:
 *
 *                            1 sal_uInt8         Pre-Tag (==0x00)
 *                            3 sal_uInt8         OffsetToEndOfRec
 *        OffsetToEndOfRec*   1 sal_uInt8         Content
 *                            1 sal_uInt8         Record-Type
 *                            1 sal_uInt8         Version
 *                            2 sal_uInt8         Tag
 *        ContentSize*        1 sal_uInt8         Content
 *
 *       (ContentSize = OffsetToEndOfRec - 8)
 *
 *  @note
 *  The reason for the structure of the record is as follows:
 *
 *  The SW record type came first, and so had to be kept 1:1.
 *  Fortunately some record tags had not been used (like 0x00 and 0xFF).
 *  <BR>
 *  =>  1st byte 0x00 can be used to identify extended records
 *  <BR>
 *  =>  1st byte 0xFF can be used for special purposes.
 *
 *  Whatever record type is present, it should be possible to recognise
 *  the type, read the header and skip the record without having to
 *  seek back or read superfluous data.
 *  <BR>
 *  =>  Bytes 2-4 are interpreted as the offset to the end of the record
 *  whatever the record, so that the total record size is equal
 *  to sizeof(sal_uInt32) + OffsetToEndOfRec
 *
 *  The records should be easy to parse and constructed uniformly
 *  <BR>
 *  =>  They build on each, for instance the SfxMiniRecord is contained
 *  in all others
 *
 *  It should be possible to distinguish the record from Drawing Engine
 *  ones. These start with 'DRMD' und 'DRVW'.
 *  <BR>
 *  =>  Mini-Records with Pre-Tag 'D' can only be up to 4MB in size,
 *  to avoid confusion.
 *
 *  @par Extensions
 *  Plans are to extend the file format in such a way that the high nibble
 *  of the record type has special duties. For instance it is planned
 *  to mark Record-Contents als 'consisting only of Records'. That way
 *  a file viewer could automatically parse these structures without
 *  risking encountering data that looks like records, but actually is
 *  flat data. Those further extensions are prepared to the extent
 *  that in type comparisons the high nibble is not taken into account.
