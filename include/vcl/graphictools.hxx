    are troublesome.

    Use this class to store geometry and attributes of a graphical
    'pen stroke', such as pen width, dashing etc. The geometry is the
    so-called 'path' along which the stroke is traced, with the given
    pen width. The cap type determines how the open ends of the path
    should be drawn. If the geometry consists of more than one
    segment, the join type determines in which way the segments are
    joined.
