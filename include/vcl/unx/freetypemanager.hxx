/**
  * The FreetypeManager caches various aspects of Freetype fonts
  *
  * It mainly consists of two std::unordered_map lists, which hold the items of the cache.
  *
  * They form kind of a tree, with FreetypeFontFile as the roots, referenced by multiple FreetypeFontInfo
  * entries, which are referenced by the FreetypeFont items.
  *
  * All of these items have reference counters, but these don't control the items life-cycle, but that of
  * the managed resources.
  *
  * The respective resources are:
  *   FreetypeFontFile = holds the mmapped font file, as long as it's used by any FreetypeFontInfo.
  *   FreetypeFontInfo = holds the FT_FaceRec_ object, as long as it's used by any FreetypeFont.
  *   FreetypeFont     = holds the FT_SizeRec_ and is owned by a FreetypeFontInstance
  *
  * FreetypeFontInfo therefore is embedded in the Freetype subclass of PhysicalFontFace.
  * FreetypeFont is owned by FreetypeFontInstance, the Freetype subclass of LogicalFontInstance.
  *
  * Nowadays there is not really a reason to have separate files for the classes, as the FreetypeManager
  * is just about handling of Freetype based fonts, not some abstract glyphs.
