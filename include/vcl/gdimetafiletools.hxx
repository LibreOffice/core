// #i121267# Added tooling to be able to support old exporters which are based on
// metafiles as graphic content, but do not implement using the contained clip
// regions.
// The given metafile will internally clip it's graphic content against the
// included clip regions so that it is safe to ignore clip actions there. This
// is not done completely, but implemented and extended as needed (on demand)
// since all this is a workarund; the better and long term solution will be to
// reimplement these im/exports to use primitives and not metafiles as base
// information.
