    You may not access vcl objects after DeInitVCL has been called this includes their destruction
    therefore disallowing the existence of static vcl object like e.g. a static BitmapEx
    To work around this use DeleteOnDeinit<BitmapEx> which will allow you to have a static object container,
    that will have its contents destroyed on DeinitVCL. The single drawback is that you need to check on the
    container object whether it still contains content before actually accessing it.

    caveat: when constructing a vcl object, you certainly want to ensure that InitVCL has run already.
    However this is not necessarily the case when using a class static member or a file level static variable.
    In these cases make judicious use of the set() method of DeleteOnDeinit, but beware of the changing
    ownership.

    example use case: use a lazy initialized on call BitmapEx in a paint method. Of course a paint method
    would not normally be called after DeInitVCL anyway, so the check might not be necessary in a
    Window::Paint implementation, but always checking is a good idea.

    SomeWindow::Paint()
    {
        static vcl::DeleteOnDeinit< BitmapEx > aBmp( ... );

        if( aBmp.get() ) // check whether DeInitVCL has been called already
            DrawBitmapEx( Point( 10, 10 ), *aBmp );
