/** @short  template for implementing singleton classes.

            Such classes can be instantiated every time they
            are needed. But the internal wrapped object will
            be created one times only. Of course its used
            resources are referenced one times only too.
            This template hold it alive till the last
            reference is gone. Further all operations
            on this reference are threadsafe. Only
            calls directly to the internal object (which modify
            its state) must be made threadsafe by the object itself
            or from outside.

    @attention  To prevent the code against race conditions, its not
                allowed to start operations inside the ctor
                of the internal wrapped object - especially operations
                which needs a reference to the same singleton too.

                The only chance to suppress such strange constellations
                is a lazy-init mechanism.

                <ul>
                    <li>a) The singleton class can provide a special init()
                           method, which must be called as first after creation.</li>
                    <li>b) The singleton class can call a special impl_init()
                           method implicit for every called interface method.</li>
                </ul>

                Note further that this singleton pattern can work only, if
                all user of such singleton are located inside the same library!
                Because static values can't be exported - e.g. from windows libraries.
