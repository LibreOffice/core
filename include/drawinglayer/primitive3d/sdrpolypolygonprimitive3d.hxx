            This 3D primitive defines a PolyPolgon in space which may have
            Line- and FillStyles and extra 3D surface attributes. It is assumed
            that the given 3D PolyPolgon (which may contain texture and normal
            information) is planar in 3D.

            The decomposition will include all needed 3D data for visualisation,
            including FatLines and fill styles.
