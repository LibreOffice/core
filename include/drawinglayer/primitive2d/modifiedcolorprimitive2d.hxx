        /** ModifiedColorPrimitive2D class

            This primitive is a grouping primitive and allows to define
            how the colors of its child content shall be modified for
            visualisation. This can be (and is) used e.g. for generic shadow
            visualisation by forcing all color usages of the contained
            sub-content to the shadow color.

            For the possibilities of color modifications, please refer
            to the basegfx::BColorModifier definitions in basegfx. For
            processing there is tooling in basegfx to build a stack of
            BColorModifierSharedPtrs to always be able to process the correct
            colors.

            If a renderer does not handle this primitive, the content will
            be visualized unchanged.
