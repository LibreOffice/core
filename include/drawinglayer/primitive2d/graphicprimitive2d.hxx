            formats. It even includes animated GIFs, Croppings and other changes
            defined in GraphicAttr.

            This makes the decomposition contain a wide variety of possibilites,
            too. From a simple BitmapPrimitive over AnimatedSwitchPrimitive2D,
            MetafilePrimitive2D (with and without embedding in a masking when e.g.
            the Metafile is bigger than the geometry) and embeddings in
            TransformPrimitive2D and MaskPrimitive2D for croppings.

            The primitive geometry area is defined by Transform.
