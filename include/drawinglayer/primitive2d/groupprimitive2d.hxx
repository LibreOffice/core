        /** GroupPrimitive2D class

            Baseclass for all grouping 2D primitives

            The grouping primitive in it's basic form is capable of holding
            a child primitive content and returns it on decomposition on default.
            It is used for two main purposes, but more may apply:

            - to transport extended information, e.g. for text classification,
              see e.g. TextHierarchy*Primitive2D implementations. Since they
              decompose to their child content, renderers not aware/interested
              in that extra information will just ignore these primitives

            - to encapsulate common geometry, e.g. the ShadowPrimitive2D implements
              applying a generic shadow to a child sequence by adding the needed
              offset and color stuff in the decomposition

            In most cases the decomposition is straightforward, so by default
            this primitive will not buffer the result and is not derived from
            BufferedDecompositionPrimitive2D, but from BasePrimitive2D.

            A renderer has to take GroupPrimitive2D derivations into account which
            are used to hold a state.

            Current Basic 2D StatePrimitives are:

            - TransparencePrimitive2D (objects with freely defined transparence)
            - InvertPrimitive2D (for XOR)
            - MaskPrimitive2D (for masking)
            - ModifiedColorPrimitive2D (for a stack of color modifications)
            - TransformPrimitive2D (for a transformation stack)
