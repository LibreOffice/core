            This is a helper class which encapsulates geometry that should be
            painted XOR, e.g. old cursor visualisations. It decomposes to
            its content, so when not supporting it, the contained geometry
            will be visualized normally.
            Unfortunately this is still needed, but hard to support on various
            systems. XOR painting needs read access to the target, so modern
            graphic systems tend to not support it anymore.
