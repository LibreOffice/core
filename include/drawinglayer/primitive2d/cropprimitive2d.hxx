        /** CropPrimitive2D class

            Caution: Due to old constraints (old core definitions) the
            crop distances describe how the uncropped content is defined
            relative to the current object size. This means that maTransformation
            describes the current object size (the part of the object visible
            with the crop applied). To get the original size and orientation
            of the uncropped content it is necessary to calc back from the
            current situation (maTransformation) using the crop values
            to get to the uncropped original content.

            Thus a transformation has to be calculated which will be applied
            to the already exsisting content to get it to the uncropped state
            ans then this is masked with the current state (mask polygon
            created from unit polygon and maTransformation).

            At least in this primitive the units of the crop values are
            already in the local coordinate system; in the core these distances
            are defined relative to the object content size (PrefMapMode
            and PrefSize of the content)...

            Of course this is a primitive, so feel free to just ignore all that
            stuff and use the automatically generated decomposition. Sigh.
