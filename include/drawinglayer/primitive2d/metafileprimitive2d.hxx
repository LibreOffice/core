        /** MetafilePrimitive2D class

            This is the MetaFile representing primitive. It's geometry is defined
            by MetaFileTransform. The content (defined by MetaFile) will be scaled
            to the geometric definition by using PrefMapMode and PrefSize of the
            Metafile.

            It has shown that this not always guarantees that all Metafile content
            is inside the geometric definition, but this primitive defines that this
            is the case to allow a getB2DRange implementation. If it cannot be
            guaranteed that the Metafile is inside the geometric definition, it should
            be embedded to a MaskPrimitive2D.

            This primitive has no decomposition yet, so when not supported by a renderer,
            it will not be visualized.

            In the future, a decomposition implementation would be appreciated and would
            have many advantages; Metafile would no longer have to be rendered by
            sub-systems and a standard way for converting Metafiles would exist.
