        /** BasePrimitive2D class

            Baseclass for all C++ implementations of css::graphic::XPrimitive2D

            This class is strongly virtual due to the lack of getPrimitiveID() implementation.
            This is by purpose, this base class shall not be incarnated and be used directly as
            a XPrimitive2D.

            It is noncopyable to make clear that a primitive is a read-only
            instance and copying or changing values is not intended. The idea is to hold all data
            needed for visualisation of this primitive in unchangeable form.

            It is derived from comphelper::OBaseMutex to have a Mutex at hand; in a base
            implementation this may not be needed, but e.g. when buffering at last decomposition
            in a local member, multiple threads may try to decompose at the same time, so locking
            is needed to avoid race conditions seen from the UNO object implementation.

            A method to get a simplified representation is provided by get2DDecomposition. The
            default implementation returns an empty sequence. The idea is that processors
            using this primitive and do not know it, may get the decomposition and process
            these instead. An example is e.g. a fat line, who's decomposition may contain
            the geometric representation of that line using filled polygon primitives. When
            the renderer knows how to handle fat lines, he may process this primitive directly;
            if not he can use the decomposition. With this functionality, renderers may operate by
            knowing only a small set of primitives.

            When a primitive does not implement get2DDecomposition, it is called a 'Basic Primitive' and
            belongs to the set of primitives which a processor should be able to handle. Practice
            will define this minimal sets of primitives. When defined and the concept is proved,
            unique UNO APIs may be defined/implemented for these set to allow more intense work
            with primitives using UNO.

            Current Basic 2D Primitives are:

            - BitmapPrimitive2D (bitmap data, evtl. with transparence)
            - PointArrayPrimitive2D (single points)
            - PolygonHairlinePrimitive2D (hairline curves/polygons)
            - PolyPolygonColorPrimitive2D (colored polygons)

            UPDATE: MetafilePrimitive2D (VCL Metafile) is taken off this list since
            it is implemented with the integration of CWS aw078 into DV300m69.

            All other implemented primitives have a defined decomposition and can thus be
            decomposed down to this small set.

            A renderer implementing support for this minimal set of primitives can completely
            render primitive-based visualisations. Of course, he also has to take states into account
            which are representated by GroupPrimitive2D derivations, see groupprimitive2d.hxx

            To support getting the geometric BoundRect, getB2DRange is used. The default
            implementation will use the get2DDecomposition result and merge a range from the
            entries. Thus, an implementation is only necessary for the Basic Primitives, but
            of course speedups are possible (and are used) by implementing the method at higher-level
            primitives.

            For primitive identification, getPrimitiveID is used currently in this implementations
            to allow a fast switch/case processing. This needs a unique identifier mechanism which
            currently uses defines (see drawinglayer_primitivetypes2d.hxx). For UNO primitive API
            it will be needed to add a unique descriptor (Name?) later to the API.

            This base implementation provides mappings from the methods from XPrimitive2D
            (getDecomposition/getRange) to the appropriate methods in the C++ implementations
            (get2DDecomposition/getB2DRange). The PropertyValue ViewParameters is converted to
            the appropriate C++ implementation class ViewInformation2D.

            This base class does not implement any buffering; e.g. buffering the decompositon
            and/or the range. These may be buffered anytime since the definition is that the primitive
            is read-only and thus unchangeable. This implies that the decomposition and/or getting
            the range will lead to the same result as last time, under the precondition that
            the parameter ViewInformation2D is the same as the last one. This is usually the case
            for view-independent primitives which are defined by not using ViewInformation2D
            in their get2DDecomposition/getB2DRange implementations.

            Baseclass for all C++ implementations of css::graphic::XPrimitive2D
            which want to buffer the decomoposition result

            Buffering the decomposition is the most-used buffering and is thus used my most
            primitive implementations which support a decomposition as base class.

            The buffering is done by holding the last decomposition in the local parameter
            maBuffered2DDecomposition. The default implementation of get2DDecomposition checks
            if maBuffered2DDecomposition is empty. If yes, it uses create2DDecomposition
            to create the content. In all cases, maBuffered2DDecomposition is returned.

            For view-dependent primitives derived from Primitive2DBufferDecomposition more needs
            to be done when the decomposition depends on parts of the parameter ViewInformation2D.
            This defines a standard method for processing these:

            Implement a view-dependent get2DDecomposition doing te following steps:
            (a) Locally extract needed parameters from ViewInformation2D to new, local parameters
                (this may be a complete local copy of ViewInformation2D)
            (b) If a buffered decomposition exists, ckeck if one of the new local parameters
                differs from the corresponding locally remembered (as member) ones. If yes,
                clear maBuffered2DDecomposition
            (d) call baseclass::get2DDecomposition which will use create2DDecomposition
                to fill maBuffered2DDecomposition if it's empty
            (e) copy the new local parameters to the corresponding locally remembered ones
                to identify if a new decomposition is needed at the next call
