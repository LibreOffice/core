        /** TransformPrimitive2D class

            This is one of the basic grouping primitives and it provides
            embedding a sequence of primitives (a geometry) into a
            transformation. All renderers have to handle this, usually by
            building a current transformation stack (linear combination)
            and applying this to all to-be-rendered geometry. If not handling
            this, the output will be mostly wrong since this primitive is
            widely used.

            It does transform by embedding an existing geometry into a
            transformation as Child-content. This allows re-usage of the
            refcounted Uno-Api primitives and their existing, buffered
            decompositions.

            It could e.g. be used to show a single object geometry in 1000
            different, transformed states without the need to create those
            thousand primitive contents.
