            This is the central masking primitive. It's a grouping
            primitive and contains a tools::PolyPolygon which defines the visible
            area. Only visualisation parts of the Child primitive sequence
            inside of the mask tools::PolyPolygon is defined to be visible.

            This primitive should be handled by a renderer. If it is not handled,
            it decomposes to its Child content, and thus the visualisation would
            contain no clips.

            The geometry range of this primitive is completely defined by the Mask
            tools::PolyPolygon since by definition nothing outside of the mask is visible.
