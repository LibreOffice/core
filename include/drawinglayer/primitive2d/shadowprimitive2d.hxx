            This primitive defines a generic shadow geometry construction
            for 2D objects. It decomposes to a TransformPrimitive2D embedded
            into a ModifiedColorPrimitive2D.

            It's for primtive usage convenience, so that not everyone has
            to implement the generic shadow construction by himself.

            The same geometry as sequence of primitives is used as geometry and
            as shadow. Since these are RefCounted Uno-Api objects, no extra objects
            are needed for the shadow itself; all the local decompositions of the
            original geometry can be reused from the renderer for shadow visualisation.
