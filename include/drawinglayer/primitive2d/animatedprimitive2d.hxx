            This is the basic class for simple, animated primitives. The basic idea
            is to have an animation definition (AnimationEntry) who's basic
            functionality is to return a state value for any given animation time in
            the range of [0.0 .. 1.0]. Depending on the state, the decomposition
            calculates an index, which of the members of the child vector is to
            be visualized.

            An example: For blinking, the Child vector should exist of two entries;
            for values of [0.0 .. 0.5] the first, else the last entry will be used.
            This mechanism is not limited to two entries, though.
