        /** TransparencePrimitive2D class

            This is the basic primitive for applying freely defined transparence
            to freely defined content. The basic idea is to associate a content
            which is defined as a sequence of primitives and hold as child content
            in the GroupPrimitive2D with a transparence channel also defined as a sequence
            of primitives and hold in the transparence member.

            The basic definition is to use the transparence content as transparence-Mask by
            interpreting the transparence-content not as RGB, but as Luminance transparence mask
            using the common RGB_to_luminance definition as e.g. used by VCL.

            The defining geometry is the Range of the child primitive sequence,
            this means the renderers will/shall use this geometric information for
            rendering, not the transparent one. The transparent one should/will be clipped
            accordingly.
