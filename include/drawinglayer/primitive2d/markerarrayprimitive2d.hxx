            This primtive defines an array of markers. Their size is defined
            in pixels and independent from the view transformation which makes
            this primitive highly view-dependent. It is also transformation
            invariant, so that the bitmap is always visualized unscaled and
            unrotated.
            It is used e.g. for grid position visualisation. The given Bitmap
            (with transparence) is defined to be visible centered at each of the given
            positions.
            It decomposes to the needed number of BitmapPrimitive2D's, so it would
            be efficient to handle it directly in a renderer.
