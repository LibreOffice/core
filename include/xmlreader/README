<http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=115203>: "Issue 113189
extracted xmlreader from configmgr, to make the former available within URE.
The xmlreader library is for now considered a private part of URE (cf.
ure/source/README), for simplicity uses OOO_DLLPUBLIC_XMLREADER-based symbol
visibility (and thus no symbol versioning), but is of course used from outside
URE in configmgr.  This works as long as its ABI does not change.  If it ever
changes, symbol versioning will have to be added (in some form or other)."
