        internally (to facilitate migration to incompatible canvases),
        ::basegfx::B2DPolygon et al. are ref-counted copy-on-write
        classes, i.e. memory shouldn't be wasted. On the other hand,
        the API polygon created internally _does_ necessarily
        duplicate the data held, but can be easily flushed away via
        flush().
