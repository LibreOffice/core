    /** is - no, not a wizard for a roadmap, but the base class for wizards
        <em>supporting</em> a roadmap.

        The basic new concept introduced is a <em>path</em>:<br/>
        A <em>path</em> is a sequence of states, which are to be executed in a linear order.
        Elements in the path can be skipped, depending on choices the user makes.

        In the most simple wizards, you will have only one path consisting of <code>n</code> elements,
        which are to be visited successively.

        In a slightly more complex wizard, you will have one linear path, were certain
        steps might be skipped due to user input. For instance, the user may decide to not specify
        certain aspects of the to-be-created object (e.g. by unchecking a check box),
        and the wizard then will simply disable the step which corresponds to this step.

        In a yet more advanced wizards, you will have several paths of length <code>n1</code> and
        <code>n2</code>, which share at least the first <code>k</code> states (where <code>k</code>
        is at least 1), and an arbitrary number of other states.

            You can only activate paths which share the first <code>k</code> states with the path
            which is previously active (if any), where <code>k</code> is the index of the
            current state within the current path.

            <example>
            Say you have paths, <code>(0,1,2,5)</code> and <code>(0,1,4,5)</code>. This means that after
            step <code>1</code>, you either continue with state <code>2</code> or state <code>4</code>,
            and after this, you finish in state <code>5</code>.<br/>
            Now if the first path is active, and your current state is <code>1</code>, then you can
            easily switch to the second path, since both paths start with <code>(0,1)</code>.<br/>
            However, if your current state is <code>2</code>, then you can not switch to the second
            path anymore.
            </example>

            @param _nPathId
                the id of the path. The path must have been declared (under this id) with
                <member>declarePath</member> before it can be activated.

            @param _bDecideForIt
                If <TRUE/>, the path will be completely activated, even if it is a conflicting path
                (i.e. there is another path which shares the first <code>k</code> states with
                the to-be-activated path.)<br/>
                If <FALSE/>, then the new path is checked for conflicts with other paths. If such
                conflicts exists, the path is not completely activated, but only up to the point
                where it does <em>not</em> conflict.<br/>
                With the paths in the example above, if you activate the second path (when both are
                already declared), then only steps <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are activated,
                since they are common to both paths.

            In the wizard's roadmap, states to travel to can be freely chosen. To prevent
            users from selecting a state which is currently not available, you can declare this
            state as being disabled.

            A situation where you need this may be when you have a checkbox which, when checked
            by the user, enables a page with additional settings. As long as this checkbox is
            not checked, the respective state would be disabled.

            Note that in theory, you can declare multiple paths, instead of disabling states.
            For instance, if you have a path where one state can be potentially disabled, then
            you could declare a second path, which does not contain this state. However, the
            disadvantage is that then, not the complete path would be visible in the roadmap,
            but only all steps up to the point where the both paths diverge.<br/>
            Another disadvantage is that the number of needed paths grows exponentially with
            the number of states which can be potentially disabled.
