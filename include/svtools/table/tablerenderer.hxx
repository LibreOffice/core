        /** paints a (part of) header area

            There are two header areas in a table control:
            <ul><li>The row containing all column headers, i.e. <em>above</em> all rows containing the data</li>
                <li>The column containing all row headers. i.e. <em>left of</em> all columns containing the data</li>
            </ul>

            A header area is more than the union of the single column/row headers.

            First, there might be less columns than fit into the view - in this case, right
            beside the right-most column, there's still room which belongs to the column header
            area, but is not occupied by any particular column header.<br/>
            An equivalent statement holds for the row header area, if there are less rows than
            fit into the view.

            Second, if the table control has both a row header and a column header,
            the intersection between those both belongs to both the column header area and the
            row header area, but not to any particular column or row header.

            There are two flags specifying whether the to-be-painted area is part of the column
            and/or row header area.
            <ul><li>If both are <TRUE/>, the intersection of both areas is to be painted.</li>
                <li>If ->_bIsColHeaderArea is <TRUE/> and ->_bIsRowHeaderArea is <FALSE/>,
                    then ->_rArea denotes the column header area <em>excluding</em> the
                    intersection between row and column header area.</li>
                <li>Equivalently for ->_bIsColHeaderArea being <FALSE/> and ->_bIsRowHeaderArea
                    being <TRUE/></li>
            </ul>
            Note that it's not possible for both ->_bIsColHeaderArea and ->_bIsRowHeaderArea
            to be <FALSE/> at the same time.

        /** prepares a row for painting

            Painting a table means painting rows as necessary, in an increasing
            order. The assumption is that retrieving data for two different rows
            is (potentially) more expensive than retrieving data for two different
            columns. Thus, the renderer will get the chance to "seek" to a certain
            row, and then has to render all cells in this row, before another
            row is going to be painted.

            @param _nRow
                the row which is going to be painted. The renderer should
                at least remember this row, since subsequent calls to
                ->PaintRowHeader(), ->PaintCell(), and ->FinishRow() will
                not pass this parameter again.

                However, the renderer is also allowed to render any
                cell-independent content of this row.
