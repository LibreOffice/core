/** Helper for 3d object changes affecting 2d geometry

   This class is a helper to encapsulate 3D object changes which shall
   change the scene's 2D geometry. E.g. when moving one 3D object in a
   scene, the visualisation would not change since the scene's 2D
   attributes are defined by its 2D object transformation and the
   changed content would be projected to the same 2D bounds as
   before. To reflect the fact that the 2D positions may 'change' for
   the user's imagination, it is necessary to calculate a new 2D
   object transformation of the scene (the SnapRect) using the old 3D
   transformation stack and the possibly modified 3D content and to
   use it. This is only desirable if changes to the scene's content
   are intended to change the scene's 2D geometry attributes
