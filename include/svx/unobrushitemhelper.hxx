//UUUU Helper function definitions for UNO API fallbacks to replace SvxBrushItem. The
// idea is to have fallbacks to create a SvxBrushItem if needed for backwards compatibility
// if needed from the SfxItemSet and vice versa. This is used in cases where e.g. UNO API
// accesses to slots in the SvxBrushItem are used (see cases in SvxBrushItem::QueryValue
// and SvxBrushItem::PutValue as MID_BACK_COLOR and similar).
// To make this work, a cycle of creating a SvxBrushItem from a SfxItemSet, changing a value
// using PutValue, putting back to the SfxItemSet should create the *same* SvxBrushItem
// the next time this will be created using getSvxBrushItemFromSourceSet. For more details,
// see comments at the implementations of that two methods.

// Set the equivalent in the range [XATTR_FILL_FIRST .. XATTR_FILL_LAST] in the given
// SfxItemSet to create the same FillStyle as is expressed by the given SvxBrushItem.
// This method will reset all items in the XATTR_FILL_* range first.

// Create a SvxBrushItem as close as possible to the settings in the DrawingLayer
// items in the range [XATTR_FILL_FIRST .. XATTR_FILL_LAST]. Since this is not 100%
// representable this may lead to reduced data. With nBackgroundID a Which-ID for the
// to-be-created SvxBrushItem has to be given (default should be 99 as in RES_BACKGROUND).
