        replacement has the same index as the current child has.

        to let a factory create the new instance with the parameters given, and then
        place the new shape into the own structures.</p>

        @param pCurrentChild
            This child is about to be replaced.

        @param _rxShape
            The UNO shape which the old and new child represent

        @param _nIndex
            The IndexInParent of the old child. Note that the index in
            parent of the replacement is not necessarily the same as
            that of the current child.
