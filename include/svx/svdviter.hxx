Using this class, you can find out:
- SdrView* First/NextView()
  - All Views in which a model is displayed
  - All Views in which a certain page is visible (also as MasterPage)
  - All Views in which a certain object is visible (also as MasterPage)
- SdrPageView* First/NextPageView()
  - All PageViews in which a model is displayed
  - All PageViews in which a certain page is visible (also as MasterPage)
  - All PageViews in which a certain object is visible (also as MasterPage)
- vcl::Window* First/NextWindow()
  - All Windows in which a model is displayed
  - All Windows in which a certain page is visible (also as MasterPage)
  - All Windows in which a certain object is visible (also as MasterPage)
You can specify if the selection is restricted to a certain page/object by
choosing the corresponding constructor.

Among others, the following are considered:
- Visibility state of the layer
- Visible Layer of MasterPages
- Multiple layer for group objects

Not considered are:
- Whether the pages/objects were already painted or if an Invalidate is still pending
- Whether the pages/objects in a Window are in a visible region
