/** <p>This interface provides the means to transform between internal
    coordinates in 100th of mm and screen coordinates without giving direct
    access to the underlying view.  Each view forwarder represents a
    specific real or virtual window.  A call to
    <method>GetVisibleArea</method> returns the visible rectangle that
    corresponds to this window.</p>

    <p>This interface is similar to the SvxViewForwarder but
    differs in two important points: Firstly the <member>GetVisArea</member>
    method returns a rectangle in internal coordinates and secondly the
    transformation methods do not require explicit mapmodes.  These have to
    be provided implicitly by the classes that implement this
    interface.  A third, less important, difference are the additional
    transfomation methods for sizes.  The reasons for their existence are
    convenience and improved performance.</p>

    @attention
        Note, that modifications of the underlying view that lead to
        different transformations between internal and screen coordinates or
        change the validity of the forwarder have to be signaled separately.
