// if we have _a_lot_ time, we should group the resource ids by type, instead
// of grouping them by semantics. The reason is that resource ids have to be
// unique relative to a fixed type (you can't have two dialogs with the same
// resource id), but they do not need to be unique globally (means you can have
// a dialog and a string, both with the same id)
// I suggest sticking to per-type ids instead of per-semantic ids, this is
// better maintainable (IMO), and does not waste that much ids

// "ModalDialog" resource ids
