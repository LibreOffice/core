/** The AccessibleChildrenManager class acts as a cache of the
    accessible objects of the currently visible shapes of a draw page and as
    a factory to create the corresponding accessible object for a given
    shape.

    <p>There are two sources of shapes.  The first is a list of UNO shapes.
    It is passes to the constructor and can be re-set with a call to
    <member>SetShapeList</member>.  Accessibility objects which represent
    these shapes are constructed usually on demand.  The second source is a
    set of single AccessibleShape objects added by calls to
    <member>AddAccessibleShape</member>.  These are not modified by this
    class.  They are only copied into the list of visible shapes depending
    on their visibility.  The later list can be cleared by calling
    <member>ClearAccessibleShapeList</member>.  The actual set of children
    accessible through the <member>GetChildrenCount</member> and
    <member>GetChild</member> methods are the accessible objects that lie
    completely or partially inside the visible area obtained from the view
    forwarder in the shape tree info.</p>

    <p>A children manager registers itself at the broadcaster passed to its
    constructor and transforms/forwards the received events to the listeners
    of the also given context base.  The transformation process includes
    interpreting a document::XEventListener, the change from
    XShape references to the associated XAccessible reference, and the
    creation of an XAccessibleEventObject.  The event object is then passed
    to the <method>fireEvent</method> method of the context and from there
    forwarded to all listeners.</p>

    <p>Note that some of the data given to the constructor is passed to the
    accessible shape objects created by that child manager which in turn
    pass these data to their child managers.  The data is thus propagated
    down a tree of child managers/accessible shape objects from a top level
    class that is usually a document/model.  This is the way to give all
    accessible objects access to data normally known only to the top level
    owner of the shapes.</p>
