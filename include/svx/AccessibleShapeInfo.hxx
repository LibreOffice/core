        This class is a container for the information specific for a single
        shape that is passed to the constructor of that shape.  It allows to
        separate the class definitions of the shapes from the information
        needed on construction.  Only the shapes' implementation has to be
        adapted to a modified AccessibleShapeInfo definition.

        AccessibleShapeTreeInfo interface which contains
        information that is passed to all shapes in a subtree not just to a
        single shape. </p>
