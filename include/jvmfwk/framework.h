/** @file
    <p>This library can operate in two modes, application mode and direct mode.</p>


    <h2>Application Mode</h2>
    In application mode the Java related settings are stored in files.
    There are currently three files which need to be accessed. They are determined
    by bootstrap parameters:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>UNO_JAVA_JFW_VENDOR_SETTINGS</dt>
    <dd>contains vendor and version information about JREs as well as the
    location of plugin-libraries which are responsible for providing information
    about these JREs as well as starting the VMs.</dd>
    <dt>UNO_JAVA_JFW_USER_DATA</dt>
    <dd>The file contains settings for a particular user. One can use the macro
    $SYSUSERCONFIG in the URL which expands to a directory where the user's data are
    kept. On UNIX this would be the home directory and on Windows some sub-directory
    of the &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; folder.The content of this file is an
    implementation detail and may change in the future.</dd>
    <dt>UNO_JAVA_JFW_SHARED_DATA</dt>
    <dd>The file contains settings valid for all users. If a user changes a setting
    then it takes precedence over the setting from UNO_JAVA_JFW_SHARED_DATA.
    The content of this file is an implementation detail and may change in the future.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>The values for these parameters must be file URLs and include the file name, for
    example:<br>
    file:///d:/MyApp/javavendors.xml<br>
    All files are XML files and must have the extension .xml.</p>
    <p>
    Modifying the shared settings is currently not supported by the framework. To provide
    Java settings for all users one can run OOo and change the settings in the
    options dialog. These settings are made persistent in the UNO_JAVA_JFW_USER_DATA.
    The file can then be copied into the base installation.
    Other users will use automatically these data but can override the settings in
    the options dialog. This mechanism may change in the future.
    </p>
    <p>If shared Java settings are not supported by an application then it is not
    necessary to specify the bootstrap parameter <code>UNO_JAVA_JFW_SHARED_DATA</code>.
    </p>

    <p>Setting the class path used by a Java VM should not be necessary. The locations
    of Jar files should be known by a class loader. If a jar file depends on another
    jar file then it can be referenced in the manifest file of the first jar. However,
    a user may add jars to the class path by using this API. If it becomes necessary
    to add files to the class path which is to be used by all users then one can use
    the bootstrap parameter UNO_JAVA_JFW_CLASSPATH_URLS. The value contains of file URLs
    which must be separated by spaces.</p>


    <h2>Direct Mode</h2>

    <p>The direct mode is intended for a scenario where no configuration files
    are available and a Java VM  shall be run. That is,
    the files containing the user and shared settings are not specified by the
    bootstrap parameters UNO_JAVA_JFW_SHARED_DATA and UNO_JAVA_JFW_USER_DATA.
    For example, tools, such as regcomp, may use this  framework in a build
    environment. Then one would want to use settings which have been specified
    by the build environment. The framework would automatically use the
    current settings when they change in the environment.
    </p>

    <p> Here are examples how regcomp could be invoked using bootstrap parameters:
    </p>
    <p>
    regcomp -env:UNO_JAVA_JFW_JREHOME=file:///d:/j2re1.4.2
    -env:&quot;UNO_JAVA_JFW_CLASSPATH=d:\\solver\\bin\\classes.jar;d:\\solver\\bin\\jurt.jar&quot;
    -register ....
    </p>
    <p>If UNO_JAVA_JFW_VENDOR_SETTINGS is not set then a plugin library must be specified. For example:</p>
    <p>
    regcomp -env:UNO_JAVA_JFW_JREHOME=file:///d:/j2re1.4.2
    -env:&quot;UNO_JAVA_JFW_CLASSPATH=d:\\solver\\bin\\classes.jar;d:\\solver\\bin\\jurt.jar&quot;
    -register ....
    </p>
    <p>Additionall parameters for the Java VM can be provided. For every parameter
    a separate bootstrap parameter must be specified. The names are
    <code>UNO_JAVA_JFW_PARAMETER_X</code>, where X is 1,2, .. n. For example:</p>
    <p>
    regcomp -env:UNO_JAVA_JFW_PARAMETER_1=-Xdebug
    -env:UNO_JAVA_JFW_PARAMETER_2=-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8100
    -env:UNO_JAVA_JFW_JREHOME=file:///d:/j2re1.4.2
    -env:&quot;UNO_JAVA_JFW_CLASSPATH=d:\\solver\\bin\\classes.jar;d:\\solver\\bin\\jurt.jar&quot;
    -register ....</p>
    <p>
    Here is a complete list of the bootstrap parameter for the direct mode:
    </p>
    <dl>
    <dt>UNO_JAVA_JFW_JREHOME</dt>
    <dd>Specifies a file URL to a JRE installation.It must ALWAYS be specified
    in direct mode</dd>
    <dt>UNO_JAVA_JFW_ENV_JREHOME</dt>
    <dd>Setting this parameter, for example to &quot;1&quot; or &quot;true&quot;,
    causes the framework to use the environment variable JAVA_HOME. It is expected
    that JAVA_HOME contains a system path rather than a file URL. This parameter
    and UNO_JAVA_JFW_JREHOME are mutually exclusive</dd>
    <dt>UNO_JAVA_JFW_CLASSPATH</dt>
    <dd>Contains the class path which is to be used by the VM. Special character,
    such as '\','{','}','$' must be preceded with '\'. See documentation about the
    bootstrap parameter.</dd>
    <dt>UNO_JAVA_JFW_ENV_CLASSPATH</dt>
    <dd>Setting this parameter,for example to &quot;1&quot; or &quot;true&quot;,
    causes the framework to use the
    environment variable CLASSPATH. If this variable and UNO_JAVA_JFW_CLASSPATH are
    set then the class path is composed from UNO_JAVA_JFW_CLASSPATH and the environment
    variable CLASSPATH.</dd>
    <dt>UNO_JAVA_JFW_PARAMETER_X</dt>
    <dd>Specifies a parameter for the Java VM. The X is replaced by
    non-negative natural numbers starting with 1.</dd>
    </dl>

    <p>A note about bootstrap parameters. The implementation of the bootstrap
    parameter mechanism interprets the characters '\', '$', '{', '}' as
    escape characters. Thats why the Windows path contain double back-slashes.
    One should also take into account that a console may have also special
    escape characters.</p>

    <h2>What mode is used</h2>
    <p>
    The default mode is application mode. If at least one bootstrap parameter
    for the direct mode is provided then direct mode is used. </p>

    <p>
    All settings made by this API are done for the current user if not
    mentioned differently.</p>

    <h2>Other bootstrap variables</h2>
    <dl>
    <dt>JFW_PLUGIN_DO_NOT_CHECK_ACCESSIBILITY</dt>
    <dd>This is a unofficial variable which was introduced to workaround external issues.
    It may be removed in the future. By setting it to 1, the framework will not try to
    find out if the system is configured to use accessibility tools or if a JRE has an
    accessible bridge installed</dd>
    <dt>JFW_PLUGIN_FORCE_ACCESSIBILITY</dt>
    <dd>This is a unofficial variable which was introduced to workaround external issues.
    It may be removed in the future. By setting it to 1, the framework will override a
    platform's desire not to probe each java backend to determine if it has an accessibility
    bridge installed. If the JFW_PLUGIN_DO_NOT_CHECK_ACCESSIBILITY is set this variable has
    no effect, and is Unix specific.</dd>

    The function obtains information about JRE installations and checks if
    there is one among them that supports

    That is, the <code>JavaInfo</code> object that refers to the JRE referred to

    <code>JFW_FEATURE_ACCESSBRIDGE</code> in the member <code>nFeatures</code>
    then the <JavaInfo></code> objects that are related to the PATH variable
    are examined.

    represents a suitable JRE. Or no such <code>JavaInfo</code> object was found.
    In that case the first <code>JavaInfo</code> object that was detected
