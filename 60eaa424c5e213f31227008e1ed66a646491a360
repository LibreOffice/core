(This is just a guess, and it may have nothing to do with this change; sorry for the noise. You are the expert in the build/link process, so you could see the real problem cause anyway :))\n\nMaybe this warning is harmless - I don\u0027t know what linker will do in that case; yet, it feels uncomfortable that debug and non-debug libraries are *attempted* to be linked at the same time (wrt memory corruption if that actually would link).",
