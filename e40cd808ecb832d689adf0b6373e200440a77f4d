Then contextmenu, edit_style, in dlg tab \u0027Text\u0027 deactivate \u0027fit height...\u0027, activate \u0027Fit to Frame\u0027.\nWhen activating TextEdit, nothing seems to happen, but as soon as you press a key (e.g. arrow-key to not change anything) display \u0027snaps\u0027 to unstretched text - probably to make it better readable during edit.\nSo I guess switching off frame is by purpose. The error is more that activated TextEdit in that case does not switch to hat mode immediately...",
