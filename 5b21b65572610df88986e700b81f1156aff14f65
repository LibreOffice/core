If it is the former, could you please rework this test so that it is resilient to legitimate divergence in floating-point calculations (e.g., involve some epsilon in the comparison of the polygon data, or rework the source .emf file so that it isn\u0027t prone to such divergence)?  (Sorry, I have too little experience with this code to do any of the above myself in a meaningful way.)",
