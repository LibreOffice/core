/* SwGrammarMarkUp extends the functionality of a "normal" SwWrongList by memorizing
   the start positions of sentences in the paragraph

   The whole class is only a temporary solution without usage of virtual functions.
   At the end the whole SwWrongList stuff should be reworked and replaced by interfaces
   to deal with all the different wronglists like
    spell, grammar, smarttag, sentence...
   "MarkUpList" would be a better name than WrongList.
