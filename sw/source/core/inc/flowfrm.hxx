/** Base class that provides the general functionalities for frames that are
    allowed at page breaks (flow) and shall continue on the next page (can be
    split), e.g. paragraphs (CntntFrm) or tables (TabFrm).

    Some parts of these functionalities are implemented in FlowFrm while the
    specific ones are done in the corresponding Frm classes. The FlowFrm has to
    be seen as a base class. As such it is no Frm by itself and thus no direct
    instances of FlowFrm can exist.

    Actually it is not even a real Frm. The obvious implementation would be a
    FlowFrm that is virtually inherited from SwFrm and that works with its own
    member data. Further classes would need to inherit from FlowFrm and (via
    multiple base classes since the class tree splits exactly at the branch
    from SwFrm to SwCntntFrm and SwLayoutFrm) also virtually from SwFrm as
    well. Unfortunately, this leads - besides problems with compilers and
    debugging programs - to high additional costs, that we IMHO are not able to
    afford nowadays.

    Hence, we use another technique: A FlowFrm keeps a reference to a SwFrm
    - which it is actually itself - and they are friends. As a result, the
    FlowFrm can work with the reference to the SwFrm instead of working with
    its own this-pointer.
