/** Base class that provides the general functionalities for frames that are
    allowed at page breaks (flow) and shall continue on the next page (can be
    split), e.g. paragraphs (ContentFrame) or tables (TabFrame).

    Some parts of these functionalities are implemented in FlowFrame while the
    specific ones are done in the corresponding Frame classes. The FlowFrame has to
    be seen as a base class. As such it is no Frame by itself and thus no direct
    instances of FlowFrame can exist.

    Actually it is not even a real Frame. The obvious implementation would be a
    FlowFrame that is virtually inherited from SwFrame and that works with its own
    member data. Further classes would need to inherit from FlowFrame and (via
    multiple base classes since the class tree splits exactly at the branch
    from SwFrame to SwContentFrame and SwLayoutFrame) also virtually from SwFrame as
    well. Unfortunately, this leads - besides problems with compilers and
    debugging programs - to high additional costs, that we IMHO are not able to
    afford nowadays.

    Hence, we use another technique: A FlowFrame keeps a reference to a SwFrame
    - which it is actually itself - and they are friends. As a result, the
    FlowFrame can work with the reference to the SwFrame instead of working with
    its own this-pointer.
