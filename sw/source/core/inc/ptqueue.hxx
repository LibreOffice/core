/**
 * Unfortunately we have some problems with processing more than one Paint()
 * at a time. This happens especially often during printing.
 *
 * SwRootFrame::Paint() determines that it's called a second time and adds the
 * rectangle and the corresponding Shell to the PaintCollector.
 * The call sites that are causing the double Paint() only need to process the
 * collected Paint()s at the right point in time.
 * Doing this during printing (after having printed one page) is very suitable
 * for doing that.
 *
 * Invalidating windows directly from the RootFrame::Paint was not a successful
 * approach, because the Paint()s arrive at a very unfavourable point in time.
 * Triggering an update for all windows after printing each page does not seem
 * appropriate either: on the one hand we don't have direct access to the edit
 * windows and on the other hand the updates can become very costly on some
 * platforms.
