Mail merge (MM) has *four modes*. The modes 1-3 are directly exposed to the
user via different GUIs. The modes are:

1. FILE    = saves the result as documents
2. PRINTER = directly printes resulting documents
3. EMAIL   = sends results as inidividual emails
4. SHELL   = returns an internal document shell for further programming

There is one property, which changes the overall behaviour of these modes:
*bCreateSingleFile*. This is the primary controller of the mail merge source
code workflow, as it affects all modes!

This also has timing contraints: for individual files the result can be
defined in advance, while further processing of the single result can just
be done after the merging. It mainly affects printing and the generation
of huge (1000+ datasets) combined non-PRINT merge results. A valid
combined document has to follow contraints, which are already met by
individual documents, as these are just modified copies.

LO currently has six working combinations of mode and *bCreateSingleFile*
The others, ''EMAIL+true'' and ''SHELL+false'', are currently not
implemented. But the list contains implementation proposals for both.

* Mode: FILE
** false: Saves each merged document as an individual file. The file name can
   be selected from a database column!
** true: Saves a combined file of concatenated documents. Each document starts
   with a new / reset page style. Depending on the page style this inserts
   hidden blank pages
* Mode: PRINTER
** false: Generates indivividual print jobs, which may be grouped on some
   platforms for easier abortion (needs verification!). All print options
   affect only the individual document! Printing starts after the first
   document is generated.
** true: Generates a single print job. All print options affect the combined
   document! This especially effects the results of reverse and N-UP printing.
   Printing can just start after all documents are generated.
* Mode: EMAIL
** false: Each document can either be used as the email body (html or txt) or
   be attached to a general email text. The emails are extracted from a DB
   column, which must be provided!
** true: *not implemented*. Could send the combined document to a single
   email address.
* Mode: SHELL
** false: *not implemented*. Instead of a single shell this could return a
   sequence of shells for the individual documents.
** true: Returns the shell of the generated document. This is mainly
   interesting for programmers. The document is just generated internally.
