        area, so this ww8::Frame simplifies matters by providing a single unified

        anchor position available from it. It hides much of the needless
        complexity of the multitude of floating/inline elements in writer, it...

        Provides a simple way to flag what type of entity this frame describes.
        Provides the size of the element as drawn by writer.
