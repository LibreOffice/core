Files with the string 'CVE' in their name are encrypted to avoid
problems with virus checkers on source code download.; use:

mdecrypt --bare -a arcfour -o hex -k 435645 -s 3 foo.doc # to unencrypt
mcrypt --bare -a arcfour -o hex -k 435645 -s 3   foo.doc # to create new tests

to get access to the plain files for manual testing.


The files in these subdirectories are tested to
ensure that they import without crashing or hanging.
Files that crash during export should go into exportdata.

Both data and exportdata are tested with
make CppunitTest_sw_filters_test      or
make CppunitTest_sw_filters_test2     for ww6.

Files that hang interactively, but pass filters_test
might be failing because of layout issues. See core/layout.

pass: these files now load - without the fix they crashed or hung.
fail: these files still fail to load, but not because of crashing or hanging.
indeterminate: untested temporary holding area - to be sorted as pass/fail.
