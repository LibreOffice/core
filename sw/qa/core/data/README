Files with the string 'CVE' in their name are encrypted to avoid
problems with virus checkers on source code download.; use:

mdecrypt --bare -a arcfour -o hex -k 435645 -s 3 foo.doc # to unencrypt
mcrypt --bare -a arcfour -o hex -k 435645 -s 3   foo.doc # to create new tests

to get access to the plain files for manual testing.

pass: these files now load - without the fix they didn't

indeterminate: ???
    -if used, ask caolanm@redhat.com to review

fail: these files used to load - with the fix they don't.
    -i.e. corrupt documents that should warn the user.
    -if used, ask caolanm@redhat.com to review

The files in the pass subdirectories are tested to
ensure that they import without crashing or hanging.
Files that crash during export should go into exportdata.

Both data and exportdata are tested with
make CppunitTest_sw_filters_test      or
make CppunitTest_sw_filters_test2     for ww6.
