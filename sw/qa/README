You can find different types of Writer tests here, the following directories
are available:

- core:
  - filters-test: loads different file types (see SwFiltersTest::testCVEs() for
    the list of supported filter types), and only makes sure Writer does not
    crash. To add new tests, you just need to drop in the test files to the
    relevant directory, no code change is necessary.
  - uwriter: this test has access to private Writer symbols, add new tests here
    if you need that.
- extras:
  - see its own README -- executes import and export filters and asserts the
    UNO model to verify the resulting document is the expected one.
  - also, any new C++ test that links to libsw (but does not need access to
    private Writer symbols) should go in this directory, whether using the UNO
    API or the internal one.
- complex: JUnit-based tests using the UNO API
- unoapi: JUnit-based test trying to get/set every UNO property, etc.
