/** This class helps to remove unwanted whitespaces from a string to use in a Tox.
 *
 * The new string will have
 * - Newlines changed to spaces
 * - Consecutive spaces merged
 * - Trailing spaces removed
 *
 * It also allows to find the corresponding new positions of the input string in the stripped string.
 * This is important for attributes which might have to be imported, e.g., it helps to answer the question:
 * The 3rd character of the input string is subscript, which character in the output string is that?
 *
 * @note One leading whitespace is preserved.
