      "message": "FWIW I think there was some value in having those in sw. SwUiWriterTest::testForcepoint3() was added in 5e18136a01208f5df7c5f554bbcdab2ef661e136, the testcase went to sw/qa and the fix was in sw/source, these pair of source + qa changes in the same module has the benefit that if you touch a module (sw/source), then you can run just the sw/ tests for quick feedback before you wait for 1h till \u0027make check\u0027 tells you if your change managed to break something or not.\n\nIt\u0027s not a big deal, so no need to revert, but if you could avoid similar changes in the future (now removing a line of code in sw/ will break a test in vcl/), that would be nice. Thanks. :-)",
