Very basic template functionality, a bit like boost or stl, but specific to LibO

From [http://blog.thebehrens.net/2006/01/15/update-cow_wrapper-is-available-now/]
The scope for o3tl is admittedly kind of ambitious, as it should contain "...very basic (template)
functionality, comparable to what's provided by boost or stl, but specific to OOo (what comes to mind
are e.g. stl adapters for our own data types and UNO, and stuff that could in principle be upstreamed
to boost, but isn't as of now)."

== Class overview ==

[git:o3tl/inc/o3tl/cow_wrapper.hxx]
A copy-on-write wrapper.

[git:o3tl/inc/o3tl/heap_ptr.hxx]
heap_ptr<> owns an object on the heap, which will be automatically deleted, when ~heap_ptr<>() is called.

[git:o3tl/inc/o3tl/lazy_update.hxx]
This template collects data in input type, and updates the output type with the given update functor,
but only if the output is requested. Useful if updating is expensive, or input changes frequently, but
output is only comparatively seldom used.

[git:o3tl/inc/o3tl/range.hxx]
Represents a range of integer or iterator values.

[git:o3tl/inc/o3tl/vector_pool.hxx]
Simple vector-based memory pool allocator.

[git:o3tl/inc/o3tl/compat_functional.hxx]
Some more templates. Contains also templates from STLport's functional header that are not part of the
C++ standard (STLport has been replaced by direct use of the C++ STL in Libre Office).
