      "message": "Here it is enough to have just the actual expression. No extra information is given in the string. Also, clearer to explicitly check against zero than to use the logical negation operator. That is, this should be just:\n\nassert(nTypeDescriptionCount \u003d\u003d 0);\n\nYou do know how assert() works, right? If that expression is false, the message printed is something like:\nAssertion failed: nTypeDescriptionCount \u003d\u003d 0",
