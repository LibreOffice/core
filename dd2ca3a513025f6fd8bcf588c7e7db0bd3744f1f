Then I open the same file in the development version of LibreOffice with the patch that you have provided here. I see a dialog box with the same message as before. I click \"Open Read-Only\", then I click on \"Edit Document\", and I get the second dialog box which is just the same as before.\n\nHow do you test your patch? Please note that there are two different dialog boxes here that show personal data.",
