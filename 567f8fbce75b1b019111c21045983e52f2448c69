      "message": "Yeah, I thought about limiting the number of columns in a cell reference. Word 365 currently limits to 63 columns in the UI, but if there is a documented limit on this for the OOXML file format that should be what controls it. In either case, I was concerned that they might increase that range in a future update, so I didn\u0027t want to impose an obscure constraint here on what is supported. But, perhaps I am overthinking it.",
