That might be due to how the actual three matches are picked, I didn\u0027t investigate deeper.\nFor example, have ABS and AND in the MRU, then start typing \u003da\nsuggests \"[AND], ACCRINT, ACCRINTM and 22 more\", ABS is even at the end of the list when travelling through with Ctrl+Tab.\nExpected would be \"[ABS], AND, ACCRINT and 22 more\" (well, my expectation..).\n",
