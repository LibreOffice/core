      "message": "You don\u0027t want to loop the entire array, which may contain more positions than the actual text is long. Beside that, it does not contain pointers, so using NULL is confusing, it\u0027s also not a NULL character, the array contains utf16 positions. And actually starts with 0, so the loop will never be executed.",
