      "message": "Thanks Christian for your review. I will proceed in different steps.\nFirst to simplify this endless list of files on one test package (wizard/report). This is this step I want you to review. \nSecond step, when you valid previous one, I will then extend to other packages of wizard\nThird step, I will merge all wizard packages in one.\n\nAfter this change is merged, same should be done to other templates and autotext",

      "message": "Agree. It is the goal of this new version.\nHowever, I\u0027ve got difficulties on this part. I don\u0027t understand why there is no need to list all the files. It needs only that there is at least one file by template. That\u0027s why I chose mimetype, because there must be one in each template. Other files do not appear in workdir, but are correctly present in instdir/share/template/common/wizard/report/*.ott\nIt works, but I don\u0027t understand why.",
