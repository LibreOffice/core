But I guess I need to look deeper into this to come up with an informed opinion here.\n\nFrom how I understand it: The user\u0027s changes to Java settings in the option dialog (like adding or selecting another JRE, changing classpath,...) are written to the user-specific \u0027javasettings_${_OS}_${_ARCH}.xml\u0027 (like \u0027instdir/user/config/javasettings_Linux_X86_64.xml\u0027 for a development build on Linux).\n\nDirect mode completely ignores the \u0027javasettings_${_OS}_${_ARCH}.xml\u0027 files (both the system-wide as well as the user-specific one, s. the \"By setting UNO_JAVA_JFW_JREHOME the framework is switched into direct mode and the office settings are disregarded.\" quote in the commit message), which is why this change avoids creating and evaluating the \u0027jfw::MergedSettings\u0027 when direct mode is used.",
