There you will have ready nWidth variable to use.",

      "message": "I was trying to offset the position from the right hence the subtraction. My thinking was \"this should be subtracted so it does not appear off screen, -20 means it will be 20 pixels inside the right\". I will try your solution to fix this.\n\nWhat size should it be set to? Doesn\u0027t it have to be relative to the tab headers since the appearance can be different among different environments (I tested on KDE and GTK modes and this is the case, GTK has taller tab headers and the button became smaller). How can I set this?",
