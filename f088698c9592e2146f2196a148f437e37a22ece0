      "message": "Thanks, this already looks great.  I have two further suggestions for improving it, if you like:\n\n* For one, while the various functions in include/comphelper/configuration.hxx can be called without an explicit XComponentContext (which then defaults to comphelper::getProcessComponentContext()), that\u0027s something of a hack, and as we already had passed around an XComponentContext here, I would suggest to keep using it.\n\n* For another, you can get rid of some of the no-longer needed #includes in extensions/source/config/WinUserInfo/WinUserInfoBe.cxx now.",
