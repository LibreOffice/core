/** describes a factory of services with interfaces for testing purposes.

    <p>It create instances that support the interface
    <type>com::sun::star::test::XSimpleTest</type>.

    <p>The services are accessed through interface, service or object
    names.  The name test service must begin with "test." followed by the
    interface, service or object name ("test.com.sun.star.beans.XPropertySet").

    @example:Java

    <listing>
    xTestService = TestFactory.createInstance( "com.sun.star.beans.XPropertySet" );
    xTestService.test( "com.sun.star.beans.XPropertySet", myTestObject );
