        be called multipe times with a new test object instance.

        didn't pass the test, the other test can still be performed. The error messages
        are cumulative.

        Test the object TestObject against the test specified with TestName using
        several threads. That does NOT mean that testMultiThread should implement
        a test using several threads but that this test method should be designed
        to be called by several threads. So for example it has to take into consi-
        deration that a test object state that is changed by the method can be
        changed again by another thread. So it's not necessarely a mistake if an
        expected state can't be confirmed after setting it. Besides of that every-
        thing is the same as decribed for the test method.

        If this way of testing with multiple threads is not appropriate for the
        component to be tested this method should not be implemented (it should
        only return -1) and a special multithread test adapted to the special
        needs of testing this component should be integrated in the test method.

        @param TestName The name of the test. Must be an interface, service or
            implementation name. Note : The name is only used by the test component
            to distinguish between test scenarios.
