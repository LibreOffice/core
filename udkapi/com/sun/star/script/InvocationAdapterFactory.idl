/** Provides functionality to create an adapter that supports (a)
    special interface type(s) and maps calls to the interface's
    methods to an invocation interface.

    <p>
    An adapter like this allows generic dispatch interfaces to
    meet interface requirements, e.g. if a specific listener
    interface has to be passed to an add...Listener method.
    </p>

    <p>
    The adapter has to support
        com::sun::star::script::XInvocationAdapterFactory.
    The adapter may also support
        com::sun::star::script::XInvocationAdapterFactory2.
