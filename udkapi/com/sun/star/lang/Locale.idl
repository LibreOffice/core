/** object represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region.

    <p>An operation that requires a <code>Locale</code> to perform
    its task is called <em>locale-sensitive</em> and uses the
    <code>Locale</code> to tailor information for the user. For example,
    displaying a number is a locale-sensitive operation; the number
    should be formatted according to the customs/conventions of the
    user's native country, region, or culture.  </p>

    <p> Because a <code>Locale</code> object is just an identifier for a
    region, no validity check is performed.  If you want to see whether
    particular resources are available for the <code>Locale</code>, use
    the <method scope="com::sun::star::resource">XLocale::getAvailableLocales</method> method to ask for the
    locales it supports.</p>

    <p> <strong>Note:</strong> When you ask for a resource for a
    particular locale, you get the best available match, not necessarily
    precisely what you asked for. For more information, see
    <type scope="com::sun::star::resource">XResourceBundle</type>.</p>

    <p> Each implementation that performs locale-sensitive operations
    allows you to get all the available objects of that type. Use the
    <typed scope="com::sun::star::resource">XLocale</type> interface to set the locale. </p>
