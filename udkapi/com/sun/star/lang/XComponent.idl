    <p>Actually the real lifetime of an UNO object is controlled by
    references kept on interfaces of this object. But there are two
    distinct meanings in keeping a reference to an interface:
    1st to own the object and 2nd to know the object.

    <p>You are only allowed to keep references of interfaces
    to UNO objects if you are by definition the owner of that object or
    your reference is very temporary or you have registered an
    EventListener at that object and release the reference when
    "disposing" is called.</p>

        <p>Only the owner of this object is allowed to call this method.
        The object should release all resources and references in the
        easiest possible manner ( for instance no serialization should
        take place anymore ).
        </p>
        <p>
        The object must notify all registered listeners using the method
        <member>XEventListener::disposing</member>. All notfied objects
        should release there references to this object without
        calling <member>XComponent::removeEventListener</member>
        (the disposed object will release the listeners eitherway).
        </p>

        <p>After this method has been called, the object should behave as passive
        as possible, thus it should ignore all calls
        in case it can comply with its specification (for instance addEventListener()).
        Often the object can't fulfill its specification anymore,
        in this case it must throw the <type>DisposedException</type>
        (which is derived from <type scope="com::sun::star::uno">RuntimeException</type>)
    when it gets called.</p>

        <p>For some objects no real owner can be identified, thus it can be
        disposed from multiple reference holders. In this case
        the object should be able to cope with multiple dispose()-calls (which
        are inevitable in a multithreaded environment).
