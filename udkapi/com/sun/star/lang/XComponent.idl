// DocMerge from xml: interface com::sun::star::lang::XComponent
/** controls the lifetime of components.



    <p>Actually the real lifetime of an UNO object is controlled by
    references kept on interfaces of this object. But there are two
    distinct meanings in keeping a reference to an interface:
    1st to own the object and 2nd to know the object. Especially in case
    of cyclic references, the objects would never get destroyed.

    </p>
    <p>You are only allowed to keep references of interfaces
    to UNO objects if you are by definition the owner of that object or
    your reference is very temporary or you have registered an
    EventListener at that object and cleared the reference when
    "disposing" is called.</p>

{
    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // DocMerge from xml: method com::sun::star::lang::XComponent::dispose
    /** The owner of a component calls this method to get rid of it.



        <p>Only the owner of this object calls the dispose method if
        the object should be destroyed. All objects and components
        must release the references to the objects. If the object is a
        broadcaster, then all listeners are removed and the method





        is called on all
        listeners.

        </p>
        <p>Due to the importance of the concept of the method





        , we provide a figurative
        example:

        </p>
        <blockquote>
        Imagine there was a hole in the floor and some people
        around it are holding a <em>box</em> (our component).
        Everyone who holds the box for a longer time than just
        temporaryly (i.e. to put something in or get something
        out) has to watch a light bulb which is attached to
        the box (listening to the





        event).
        Now, when the owner of the box switches the light on
        (calling




        ),
        everybody holding the box has to take his hands off
        (clear the interface handles). If and only if everyone
        does that, then the box falls (getting deleted).
        But only the owner is allowed to switch the light on!
        </blockquote>

        <p>After this method is called the instance has to throw the
        <type>DisposedException</type> for
        all calls not non-event-methods; event-methods have to be ignored.

        </p>





        @example <listing>
        void dispose()
        {
        // make a copy
        Listener [] aTmpListeners = MyListeners.clone();

        // clear all listeners (against recursion)
        MyListeners.clear();

        // call all listeners
        EventObject aEvt = new EventObject();
        aEvt.xSource = this;
        for( i = 0; i &amp;lt;aTmpListeners.length; i++ )
        aTmpListeners[i].disposing( aEvt );
        }
        </listing>
     */
    void dispose();

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // DocMerge from xml: method com::sun::star::lang::XComponent::addEventListener
    /** adds an event listener to the object.



        <p>The broadcaster fires the disposing method of this listener
        if the




        method is called.

        </p>@see removeEventListener()
     */
    void addEventListener( [in] XEventListener xListener );

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // DocMerge from xml: method com::sun::star::lang::XComponent::removeEventListener
    /** removes an event listener from the listener list.



        <p>It is a "noop" if the specified listener is not registered.

        </p>@see addEventListener()
     */
    void removeEventListener( [in] XEventListener aListener );
