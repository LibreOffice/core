// DocMerge from idl: interface com::sun::star::lang::XConnectionPoint
/** supports connection points for connectable objects.

    <p>Connectable objects support the following features: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>outgoing interfaces, such as event sets; </li>
        <li>the ability to enumerate the types of the outgoing interfaces;
        <li>the ability to connect and disconnect sinks to the object
            for those outgoing types; </li>
        <li>the ability to enumerate the connections that exist to a
            particular outgoing interface.  </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>When to Implement?<h4>

    <p>To create a connectable object, you need to implement objects
    that provide two related interfaces: </p>

    <ul>
        <li><type>XConnectionPointContainer</type> </li>
        <li><type>XConnectionPoint</type> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The <type>XConnectionPointContainer</type> interface is implemented
    on the connectable object to indicate the existence of the outgoing
    interfaces. It provides a sequence of sub-objects.  It also provides
    access to all the connection point sub-objects, each of which
    implements the <type>XConnectionPoint</type> interface. The
    <type>XConnectionPoint</type> interface provides a sequence of
    sub-objects.  </p>

    <p>Each connection point is a separate sub-object to avoid circular
    reference counting problems.  A connection point controls how many
    connections (one or more) it will allow in its implementation of
    <member>XConnectionPoint::advise()</member>.  </p>

    <h4>When to use?</h4>

    <p>A client can use the <type>XConnectionPointContainer</type> interface: </p>

    <UL>

        <LI>to get a sequence of connection points for each outgoing type. </LI>

        <LI>to obtain access to connection point sub-objects with the
            <type>XConnectionPoint</type> interface for each
            outgoing type. Through the XConnectionPoint interface,
            a client starts or terminates an advisory loop with the
            connectable object and the client's own sink.  The
            client can also use the <type>XConnectionPoint</type>
            interface to get a sequence of the connections that it
            knows about. </LI>
    </UL>
