/** indicates that there is no Java available <p>
    It is presumed that Java is a vital part of an office installation.
    That is, if Java does work for some reason, it is not guaranteed that
    the office is functional. A JavaInitializationException is therefore
    caused by some misconfiguration of Java which is closer described by
    other exceptions in this namespace which inherit JavaInitializationException.
    These are:
    <p>
    com::sun::star::java::JavaDisabledException <br>
    com::sun::star::java::JavaNotConfiguredException <br>
    com::sun::star::java::MissingJavaRuntimeException <br>
    com::sun::star::java::JavaVMCreationFailureException <br>
