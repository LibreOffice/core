/** Service to create proxy objects acting on behalf of a given
    target object.<br>
    A proxy delegates calls to a given target object.
    In addition, it is aggregatable, thus it is possible to
    intercept calls on the proxy's interfaces.

    @attention
    A proxy object is UNO conform, but does NOT provide original target
    interfaces on queryInterface() calls.  This may lead to problems
    regarding object identity, e.g. when dealing with listener proxies.

    @deprecated
    Aggregation will no longer be supported as a high-level concept of UNO.
    You may still have the option to implement an UNO object consisting of
    several single objects in your specific programming language, though this
    depends on your programming language.
    Thus this service is deprecated, too.
