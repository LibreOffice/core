/** Factory interface to produce proxy objects.

    @deprecated
    Aggregation will no longer be supported as a high-level concept of UNO.
    You may still have the option to implement an UNO object consisting of
    several single objects in your specific programming language, though this
    depends on your programming language.
    Thus this interface is deprecated, too.

    /** This method creates a new proxy object that acts on behalf of the given
        target object.<br>
        The proxy delegates calls to the given target object.
        In addition, it is aggregatable, thus it is possible to
        intercept calls on the proxy's interfaces.

        @attention
        The proxy object is UNO conform, but does NOT provide original target
        interfaces on queryInterface() calls.  This may lead to problems
        regarding object identity, e.g. when dealing with listener proxies.
