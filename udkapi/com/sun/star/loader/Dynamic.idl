   Makes it possible to access services accessible via a <code>UnoUrlResolver</code>
   E.g., instantiation of services in another process. This service is still in an
   experimental state and should not be used in a production environment.

   Is used to write persistent information into the given registry
   for accessing a <code>SingleServiceFactory</code> and for activating this
   implementation.

   Allows registration and activation of described service.
    The url parameter has to be a comma-separated list of attributes.
    The following attribute types are understood:
    servicename = the service name to register this component under
    link        = a parameter given to a resolver to get a <code>SingleServiceFactory</code>
    resolver    = a <code>UnoUrlResolver</code> service, which is used to resolve the link
