/** A service that has to deal with macrofied strings will preprocess those
    strings using the macro expander singleton.
    The macro expander singleton is deployed with the application.

    This feature is currently used macrofying loader urls with macros defined
    in uno.ini/unorc bootstrap files.  The component loader uses the macro
    expander singleton to expand those macros.  This is a flexible way
    preprocessing loader urls.
