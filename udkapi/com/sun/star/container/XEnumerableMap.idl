/** extends XMap with enumeration capabilities.

    <p>No assumption should be made about the ordering of the elements returned by the various enumerators.
    In particular, you cannot assume the elements are returned in the same order as they were inserted. Also,
    you should not expect the <code>XMap</code> implementation to make use of a possibly existing strict ordering
    defined on the domain of all possible key values.</p>

    <p>You can create enumerators for the keys of the map, its values, and its key-value pairs.</p>

    <p>In all cases, you can create an <em>isolated</em> enumerator, which works on a copy of the
    map's content. Such an iterator is not affected by changes done to the map after creation of
    the enumerator.</p>

    <p>On the contrary, an enumerator which is <em>non-isolated</em> works directly on the map data.
    This is less expensive than an <em>isolated</em> enumerator, but means that changes to the map while
    an enumeration is running potentially invalidate your enumerator. The concrete behavior in this
    case is undefined, it's up to the service implementing the <code>XEnumerableMap</code> interface
    to specify it in more detail.</p>

    <p>Implementations of this interface might decide to support only <em>isolated</em> enumerators, or
    only <em>non-isolated</em> enumerators. Again, it's up to the service to specify this. Requesting an
    enumerator type which is not supported will generally result in an com::sun::star::lang::NoSupportException
    being thrown.</p>
