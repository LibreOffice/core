        <p>This method should always be called in the scope of the local bridge setting object,

        (typically at startup time). </p>

        @param nRandomNumber
            In case both processes call requestChange at the same time,
             the caller with the higher nRandomNumber is allowed to call
             commitChange.

        @returns
            1, if the caller may ( and MUST !!!) call commitChange.
            0, if the caller is not allowed to call commitChange. This can only happen,
               if the other bridge has called requestChange at the same time and
               nRandomNumber is smaller than the other bridge's nRandomNumber.
               The remote counterpart is supposed to call commitChange within a small
               time span. Please call requestChange() after the remote counterpart has
               called commitChange().
            -1 if the nRandomNumber is of the same value as the previously
               sent requestChange (sent by the remote counterpart). This is a draw :o).
               Generate a new random number and try again.

        <p>It is only allowed to call commitChange, if requestChange
        has been called previously and the return value was true.  The new properties are
        valid after the reply of commitChange has been received.
        Note, that this is difficult for the callee, because it must marshal the reply
        with the old settings. </p>

        <p>All properties not mentioned in the list are unchanged.
        Note that the bridge must be blocked for other threads,
        before commitChange is sent and unblocked
        after the reply has been received. This blocks the bridge.</p>
