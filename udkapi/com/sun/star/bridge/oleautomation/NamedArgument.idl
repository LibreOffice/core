/** represents a named argument in a call to a method of an Automation object.
    <p>
    The Automation bridge accepts values of NamedArgument when a
    call to an Automation object is made. The call is done through the
    com::sun::star::script::XInvocation::invoke()
    method, which takes all arguments in a sequence of anys. Usually the order
    of the arguments must correspond to the order of arguments in the Automation
    method. By using instances of NamedArgument the arguments in the
    sequence can be unordered. The Automation object being called must support
    named arguments, otherwise the call fails.
