/** is the UNO representation of the Automation type <code>CY</code>, also know
    as <code>CURRENCY</code>.
    <p>
    A <code>CY</code> could actually be represented as <atom>hyper</atom> in UNO
    and therefore a typedef from <atom>hyper</atom> to a currency type would do.
    But a typedef cannot be expressed in all language bindings. In the case
    where no typedefs are supported the actual type is used. That is, a
    typedef'd currency type would be represented as <code>long</code> in Java.
    The information that the <code>long</code> is a currency type is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
    When calling Automation objects from UNO the distinction between
    <atom>hyper</atom> and a currency type is important. Therefore
    <type>Currency</type> is declared as struct.
