/** maps UNO types to oleautomation types and vice versa.
    <p>
    The function
    <member scope="com::sun::star::bridge">XBridgeSupplier2::createBridge</member>
    maps a value of a UNO or Automation type to the desired target type. If a UNO
    interface was mapped  to <code>IDispatch</code>, then all objects
    (interfaces, structs) and other types which are obtained from that Automation
    object are automatically mapped to the corresponding Automation types. Hence,
    if one provides an initial object which forms the root of all other objects,
    such as a service manager, then only that object needs to be explicitly
    mapped by a call to
    <member scope="com::sun::star::bridge">XBridgeSupplier2::createBridge</member>.
    The same holds true if an automation  object is mapped to an UNO interface.
    </p>
    <p>
    For Automation objects to be mapped they have to implement
    <code>IDispatch</code> interface. Other COM interfaces, except for
    <code>IUnknown</code>, are not supported. UNO interfaces and structs are
    mapped to <code>IDispatch</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The service implements the
    <type scope="com::sun::star::bridge">XBridgeSupplier2</type> interface and
    handles the model types
    <const>com::sun::star::bridge::ModelDependent::UNO</const> and
    <const>com::sun::star::bridge::ModelDependent::OLE</const>.
    The service does not specify any requirements for registering OLE objects and
    class factories.
    </p>
