/** a tagging interface for UNO objects which represent Automation
    objects.
    <p>
    If a Automation object is bridged into the UNO environment, then
    the resulting UNO object does not distinguish itself from any
    other ordinary UNO object. However, it may be desirable to have
    that distinction regardless, if a UNO client needs to take
    particular Automation specific characteristics into account.
    By providing <type>XAutomationObject</type> an object declares
    to be representing an Automation object.
