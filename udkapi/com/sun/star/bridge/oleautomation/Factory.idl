/** makes it possible to create COM objects as UNO objects.

    <p>
    A COM object must have a ProgId since the ProgId is used as argument for
    <method scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiServiceFactory::createInstance</method>.
    The only interfaces which are mapped are <code>IUnknown</code> and
    <code>IDispatch</code>. The created UNO objects support
    <type scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocation</type> if the original COM
    objects support <code>IDispatch</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    The optional parameters of the method
    <method scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiServiceFactory::createInstanceWithArguments</method>
    are reserved for future use; at this time they are ignored.
