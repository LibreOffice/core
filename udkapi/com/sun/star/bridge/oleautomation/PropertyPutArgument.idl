/** contains a value that is used as argument in a &quot;property put&quot
    operation on a Automation object.
    <p>
    If a Automation object is converted into a UNO object by a scripting
    bridge, such as
    <type scope="com::sun::star::bridge::oleautomation">BridgeSupplier</type>,
    then it is accessed through the
    <type scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocation</type> interface.
    The methods
    <member scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocation::setValue</member>
    and
    <member scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocation::getValue</member>
    are used to access properties which do not have additional
    arguments. To access a property with additional arguments, the
    method
    <member scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocation::invoke</member>
    has to be used. The method implementation must decide, if the
    property is to be written or read so it can perform the proper
    operation on the Automation object. To make this decision, the
    caller has to provide the information if the current call is
    intended to be a write or read operation. This is done by
    providing either instances of <type>PropertyPutArgument</type> or
    <type>PropertyGetArgument</type> as arguments to
    <member scope="com::sun::star::script">XInvocation::Invoke</member>.
