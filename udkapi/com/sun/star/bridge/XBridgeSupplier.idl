// DocMerge from xml: interface com::sun::star::bridge::XBridgeSupplier
/** defines the interface for creating bridges to other object models.

    <p>Because bridges sometimes can not be generated in an address space,
    the implementation needs to check the address space of the caller by
    comparing the machine and process ID against its own. These IDs are
    provided by the UNO runtime.  </p>

    <p>All objects, whether they are part of the UNO object model or not,
    are carried in an <atom>any</atom>.  The representation of this object
    is heavily model-dependent and has to be specified in the following list: </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>UNO: </dt>
        <dd>The any carries normal UNO types, which can be any base type,
        struct, sequence, enum, or interface.  </dd>

        <dt>OLE:    </dt>
        <dd>The any carries an <atom>unsigned long</atom> (on 32-bit systems)
        or an <atom>unsigned hyper</atom> (on 64-bit systems), which is
        interpreted as a variant pointer. The any does not control the
        lifetime of the represented variant. That implies that the caller
        has the responsibility of freeing the OLE resources represented
        by the any value.  </dd>

        <dt>JAVA:   </dt>
        <dd>not yet specified.  </dd>

        <dt>CORBA: </dt>
        <dd>not yet specified.  </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Any implementation can supply its own bridges to other object
    models by implementing this interface and returning the bridge
    when the method is called with itself as the first parameter. </p>
