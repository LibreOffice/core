        <dd>All of an object's attributes are considered as properties
        with same name. If an attribute is read-only, the property

        "RetType" for its type. The method must not have any
        parameters, or there is no property access method
        and "X" has no property.  If there is also a method
        <code>void setX( [in] RetType )</code>, the property
        "X" also allows write access; otherwise it is read-only.
