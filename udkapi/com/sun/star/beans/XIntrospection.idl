            <dd>All of an object's attributes are considered as properties
                with same name. If an attribute is read-only, the property
                also is read-only.

                property where "X" stands for the property name and
                "RetType" for its type. The method must not have any
                parameters, or there is no property access method
                and "X" has no property.  If there is also a method
                <code>void setX( [in] RetType )</code>, the property
                "X" also allows write access; otherwise it is read-only.

            <dd>If an object implements <type scope="com::sun::star::container">XNameAccess</type>,
                the items that can be accessed are not considered as properties
                of the object and so are not included in the property list offered by

        <p>In addition, the inspect method identifies all listener
        access methods in the form <code>add...Listener</code>/
        <code>remove...Listener</code> (except methods of interface
        <type>XPropertySet</type>) where "..." stands for the listener type.
