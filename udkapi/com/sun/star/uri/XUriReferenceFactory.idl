       resolves a relative URI reference to absolute form.

       @param baseUriReference
       the base URI reference.  If the given <code>uriReference</code> is a
       same-document reference, <code>baseUriReference</code> is used as a
       reference to the current document.

       @param uriReference
       any URI reference.  Backwards-compatible relative URI references starting
       with a scheme component (see RFC&nbsp;3986, Sections 5.2.2 and&nbsp;5.4,2)
       are not supported; instead, they are interpreted as absolute
       URI references.

       @param processAdditionalSpecialSegments
       if `TRUE`, special segments (&ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo; and
       &ldquo;<code>..</code>&rdquo;) within the path of the base URI (except
       for the last, cut-off segment), and within an already absolute <code>uriReference</code>, are
       processed as required by
       RFC&nbsp;3986.  If `FALSE`, such special segments
       are treated like ordinary segments.
       Conformance with RFC&nbsp;3986 requires `TRUE` to be passed.

       @param excessParentSegments
       details how excess special parent segments
       (&ldquo;<code>..</code>&rdquo;) are handled.
       Conformance with RFC&nbsp;3986 requires REMOVE to be passed.

       a fresh object that supports
       com::sun::star::uri::XUriReference (and possibly also
       additional, scheme-specific interfaces), if the given
       <code>uriReference</code> can be resolved
       to an absolute URI reference, relative to the given
       <code>baseUriReference</code>; otherwise, `NULL` is returned.
       Especially, if <code>baseUriReference</code> is `NULL`, or is not an
       absolute URI reference, or if <code>uriReference</code> is
       `NULL`, then `NULL` is always returned.

       relative URI reference includes an authority component (e.g.,

       relative URI reference has a relative path (e.g.,

       controls how a relative URI reference is generated when both
       <code>baseUriReference</code> (e.g.,

       <code>uriReference</code> (e.g.,

       reference has a relative path (e.g., &ldquo;<code>../c/d</code>&rdquo;).
