/**
   creates URI references.

   <p>See <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC&nbsp;2396</a> for a
   description of URI references and related terms.</p>

   <p>For parsing absolute URI references, this service tries to use a
   scheme-specific parser.  Such a scheme-specific parser will typically enforce
   additional restrictions during parsing, and will typically return objects
   that support extra, scheme-specific interfaces in addition to
   com::sun::star::uri::XUriReference.  If no such parser
   is found, and for relative URI references, a generic parser is used, which
   returns objects that only support
   com::sun::star::uri::XUriReference.</p>

   <p>Locating a scheme-specific parser works as follows:  A scheme consists of
   Latin capital letters
   &ldquo;<code>A</code>&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;<code>Z</code>&rdquo;, Latin small
   letters &ldquo;<code>a</code>&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;<code>z</code>&rdquo;,
   digits &ldquo;<code>0</code>&rdquo;&ndash;&ldquo;<code>9</code>&rdquo;,
   &ldquo;<code>+</code>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<code>-</code>&rdquo;, and
   &ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo;.  A scheme&nbsp;<var>s</var> is transformed into
   a string&nbsp;<var>s</var>&prime; character-by-character, by translating
   Latin capital letters to their small counterparts, translating
   &ldquo;<code>+</code>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<code>PLUS</code>&rdquo;,
   &ldquo;<code>-</code>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<code>HYPHEN</code>&rdquo;,
   &ldquo;<code>.</code>&rdquo; to &ldquo;<code>DOT</code>&rdquo;, and copying
   Latin small letters and digits unchanged.  If the component context used
   while creating this <code>UriReferenceFactory</code> instance offers a
   service manager, and there is a service available at that service manager
   whose name is the concatenation of
   &ldquo;<code>com.sun.star.uri.UriSchemeParser_</code>&rdquo; and
   <var>s</var>&prime;, then that service is used.  It is an error if that
   service does not support
   com::sun::star::uri::XUriSchemeParser.</p>
