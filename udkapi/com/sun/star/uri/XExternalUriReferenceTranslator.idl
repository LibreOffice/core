/**
   translates between external and internal URI references.

   <p>Some URI schemes leave unspecified important aspects of how to interpret
   URIs of those schemes.  For example, it is unspecified for &ldquo;file&rdquo;
   URLs how to map the byte sequences that constitute the path segments of a
   &ldquo;file&rdquo; URL to filenames on a given platform:  The UNO environment
   always assumes that path segments of &ldquo;file&rdquo; URLs represent
   UTF-8&ndash;encoded strings (which have to be mapped to filenames in a
   platform-specific way), while other applications typically assume that path
   segments of &ldquo;file&rdquo; URLs directly represent a platform's
   byte-sequence filenames.  This interface offers methods to translate between
   such <dfn>internal</dfn> URIs (e.g., UTF-8&ndash;encoded &ldquo;file&rdquo;
   URLs used within the UNO environment) and <dfn>external</dfn> URIs (e.g.,
   byte-sequence&ndash;oriented &ldquo;file&rdquo; URLs used by other
   applications).  Typically, only &ldquo;file&rdquo; URLs are affected by this
   translation.</p>

   <p>Since the translation process is based on URI schemes, relative URI
   references (that do not include a scheme) are left unmodified by the
   translation process.</p>
