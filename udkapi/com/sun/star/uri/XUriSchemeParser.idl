       <p>If an object is returned, the behaviour of its
       <type scope="com::sun::star::uri">XUriReference</type> methods must
       reflect the fact that the object represents an absolute URI reference

       part.</p>

       @param scheme
       the textual representation of the scheme part (without the delimiting
       &ldquo;<code>:</code>&rdquo;).

       @param uriReference
       the textual representation of the scheme-specific part.

       @returns
       an object that supports
       <type scope="com::sun::star::uri">XUriReference</type> (and possibly also
       additional, scheme-specific interfaces), if the given input can be parsed
       into an absolute URI; otherwise, <NULL/> is returned.
