// DocMerge from xml: service com::sun::star::uno::NamingService
/** provides a collection of global reachable objects.



    <p>Normally an uno application exposes its external reachable objects
    through this service. It is up to the implementation, how the registered
    objects are exposed to the rest of the world. Which objects are
    reachable from the outside are implementation specific.

    </p>
    <p>To extend the reachability change the naming service. To access the
    process local naming service normally use your ServiceManager. If you are
    outside of UNO you can access the shared library "unonamingservice". This library
    exports a c-style function "createComponentFactory". All parameters can be set
    to null. Look at the service specification of the shared library loader.<br>
    In Java the class name of the naming component is "com.sun.star.comp.nameservice.NameService".
    If Java is embedded in a native system this component should connect to the
    native library.
