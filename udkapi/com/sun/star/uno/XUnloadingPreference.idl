/** Components can implement <code>XUnloadingPreference</code> in order to indicate
    how they should be treated when their hosting library is to be unloaded.

   When someone calls <code>rtl_unloadUnusedModules</code> then the unloading
    listeners are notified by calling previously registered callback
    functions. A listener is an entity that employs, registers, and
    unregisters the callback functions on its behalf. Upon notification
    (the callback function is being called)
    a listener may release references to UNO components. Thus, the
    loaded libraries can be unloaded, if no one else keeps any
    objects from the library alive. <br>
    Before a listener releases references, it should ask for this interface.
    If the interface is not implemented, then the listener may release the
    object; otherwise, it calls <code>releaseOnNotification</code>. If the function
    returns false then the listener should keep the reference, otherwise
    it may release it.
