/** Objects which implement this interface can become aggregates of
    a delegator.

    <p>That means if an object "A" aggregates "B", "A" can provide all
    or some of the interfaces of "B". Whenever the method
    <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>
    is called on either of the objects, the call will be forwarded
    to object "A". Object "A" now can determine whether to use the
    interfaces of "A" or "B" or neither. Actually, any number of
    aggregates can be used, even nested ones (aggregated objects which are
    delegators by themselves).

    <p>The following rules are to be observed:
    <ol>
    <li>All calls to <member>XInterface::acquire()</member>
    which are made before the delegator was set (using the method
    <member>XAggregation::setDelegator()</member>) must not be taken back
    (using the method <member>XInterface::release()</member>)
    before the delegation is removed by calling
    <code>xAggregation-&gt;setDelegator(NULL)</code>.

    <li>The constructor of a delegator has to increment its
    own reference count by calling its method
    <member>XInterface::acquire()</member>
    before it sets itself to any aggregate using the method
    <member>XAggregation::setDelegator()</member>. After that
    call it has to reset its own reference count without the
    destructor getting called.

    <li>The destructor of a delegator has to reset the delegator in
    its aggregated objects by calling their method
    <member>XAggregation::setDelegator()</member> with
    <const>NULL</const> before it releases its reference to
    its aggregated objects.
    </ol>

interface XAggregation: com::sun::star::uno::XInterface
{
    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /** sets the object to which all calls to the method
        <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>
        have to be forwarded. @

        @param xDelegator
        specifies the object which handles the calls to
        <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>.
        If <var>xDelegator</var> is <const>NULL</const>, the delegator is
        removed and thus the object becomes its own delegator and has
        to handle calls to the method
        <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>
        itself.

        @example:Java

        <listing>

        void setDelegator( com.sun.star.uno.XInterface aDelegator )
        {
        pDelegator =aDelegator;
        }


        com.sun.star.uno.XInterface queryInterface( com.sun.star.uno.Uik aUik )
        {
        com.sun.star.uno.XInterface pRet = null;

        // pDelegator may be already set
        if( pDelegator == null )
        pRet = queryAggregation( aIFace );
        else
        pRet = pDelegator->queryInterface( aIFace );
        return pRet;
        }

        </listing>

        @see XAggregation::queryAggregation
    */
    void setDelegator( [in] com::sun::star::uno::XInterface pDelegator );

    //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /** is similar to <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>,
        but it is to be processed directly without being forwarded to the
        delegator. @

        <p>This method is only called from within an implementation of
        <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>
        or <member>XAggregation::queryAggregation()</member>. This method
        is to be called by the delegator if it does not implement the
        interface itself. An object which got aggregated cannot depend
        on getting its own interface when it calls the method
        <member>XInterface::queryInterface()</member>.

        @example:Java

        <listing>

        Class queryAggregation( Class aIFace )
        {
        // The Uno-System provides information about their own interfaces
        Class pRet = Uno.getInterface( this, aIFace );

        if( pRet == null )
        // not an own interface, thus forward to the aggregated object
        pRet = aMyAggObj->queryAggregation( aIface );
        return pRet;
        }

        </listing>

        @see XAggregation::setDelegator
    */
    any queryAggregation( [in] type aType );
//  boolean queryAggregation( [in] com::sun::star::uno::Uik aUik,
//           [out] any ifc );
