/** The AllPermission is a permission that implies all other permissions.

    @attention
    Granting AllPermission should be done with extreme care, as it implies all
    other permissions.  Thus, it grants code the ability to run with security
    disabled.  Extreme caution should be taken before granting such a
    permission to code.  This permission should be used only during testing,
    or in extremely rare cases where an application is completely trusted and
    adding the necessary permissions to the policy is prohibitively cumbersome.
