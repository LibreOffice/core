/** This meta service supports the XAccessController interface for checking
    security permissions.

    @attention
    The specific service implementation of this meta service has to take care
    of bootstrapping problems, i.e. recurring calls during initialization
    have to be resolved.  This happens when the implementation calls other
    service implementations.

    Also, it obviously has also to be ensured that the object is process-local
    to assure that permission checks are not corrupted via insecure inter-process
    communication.
