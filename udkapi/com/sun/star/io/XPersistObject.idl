/** allows to make UNO objects persistent

  <p>Every UNO object, that wants to be serializable, should implement
     this interface. The object stores stores itself, when the
     write method is called.
     <p>
     The object needs to be created before it deserializes
     itself again (by using the read method). Therefor it must be
     createable by name via a factory, which is in general
     the global service manager. The create and read mechanism
     is implemented by the <type scope="com::sun::star::io">ObjectInputStream</type>.

     <p>The serialization format (the series of strings, integers, objects) must
     be specified at the specification of the concrete service.

     <p>The interface does not support any special versioning mechanism.
