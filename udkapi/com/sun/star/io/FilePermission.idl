/** This permission represents access to a file or directory.
    A FilePermission consists of a file url and a set of actions valid for that url.
    <p>
    The path of the file url that ends in <code>"/*"</code> indicates all the files and
    directories contained in that directory.  A path that ends with <code>"/-"</code>
    indicates (recursively) all files and subdirectories contained in that
    directory.  A file url string consisting of the special token
    <code>"&lt;&lt;ALL FILES&gt;&gt;"</code> matches any file.
    <br>
    Note: A file url string consisting of a single <code>"*"</code> indicates all the files
    in the current directory, while a string consisting of a single <code>"-"</code> indicates
    all the files in the current directory and (recursively) all files and
    subdirectories contained in the current directory.
    <br>
    The actions to be granted is a list of one or more comma-separated keywords.
    The possible keywords are <code>"read"</code>, <code>"write"</code>,
    <code>"execute"</code>, and <code>"delete"</code>.
    Their meaning is defined as follows:
    <ul>
    <li><code>read</code> -- read permission</li>
    <li><code>write</code> -- write permission</li>
    <li><code>execute</code> -- execute permission</li>
    <li><code>delete</code> -- delete permission</li>
    </ul><br>
    The actions string is processed case-insensitive.
    </p>

    @attention
    Be careful when granting FilePermissions.  Think about the implications of
    granting read and especially write access to various files and directories.
    The <code>"&lt;&lt;ALL FILES&gt;&gt;"</code> permission with write action is
    especially dangerous.  This grants permission to write to the entire file system.
