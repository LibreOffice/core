/** is a stream which allows writing the data of persistent objects.

    <p>Implementations of this service must fulfill the specifications of the
    DataOutputStream service; furthermore, the stream needs to be chained to a
    XMarkableStream. Therefore, it also provides the XMarkableStream
    interface, but it delegates the calls to the chained object.
    The written objects are held until this instance is destroyed.
    The references to the objects are written as four-byte integers
    and begin at 1. Data format is written: </p>
    <pre>
    short   InfoLength
    long    ObjectReference // 0 indicates no object
    UTF     ServiceName     // length of 0 indicates this is only a reference
    long    ObjectLength    // 0 if it is a reference or no object, otherwise the len of the object data
    Object  ObjectData      // the data of the object
    </pre>

    @note
    <ul>
        <li>-thread safe </li>
        <li>-allow buffer size is 2 ^ 31 -1 </li>
        <li>-maximum object reference identifier is the number of objects.  </li>
        <li>-object reference identifier 0 indicates no object </li>
