/** is a stream which allows reading the data of persistent objects.

    <p>Implementations of this service must fulfill the specifications of the
    <type>DataInputStream</type> service. It must be chained to an
    <type>XMarkableStream</type>. Therefore, it provides the
    <type>XMarkableStream</type> interface, and delegates the calls to the
    chained object.  </p>
    <p>The written objects are held until this instance is destroyed.
    The references to the objects are read as four-byte integers.
    Data format reads:</p>

    <pre>
    short   InfoLength
    long    ObjectReference  // 0 indicates no object
    UTF     ServiceName      // length of 0 indicates this is only a reference
    long    ObjectLength     // 0 if it is a reference or no object, otherwise the len of the object data
    Object  ObjectData       // the data of the object
    ...                      // skipping additional data
    </pre>
