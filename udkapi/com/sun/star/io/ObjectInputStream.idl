/** is a stream which allows reading the data of persistent objects.

    <p>Implementations of this service must fulfill the specifications of the
    DataInputStream service. It must be chained to an
    XMarkableStream. Therefore, it provides the
    XMarkableStream interface, and delegates the calls to the
    chained object.  </p>
    <p>The written objects are held until this instance is destroyed.
    The references to the objects are read as four-byte integers.
    Data format reads:</p>

    <pre>
    short   InfoLength
    long    ObjectReference  // 0 indicates no object
    UTF     ServiceName      // length of 0 indicates this is only a reference
    long    ObjectLength     // 0 if it is a reference or no object, otherwise the len of the object data
    Object  ObjectData       // the data of the object
    ...                      // skipping additional data
    </pre>
