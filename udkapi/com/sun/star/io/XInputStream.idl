        and the return value indicates that EOF has been reached. This means

             C++ only : Note that for unbridged (e.g., in-process)
             calls, using the same sequence for repetitive readBytes()-calls
             can bear a performance advantage. The callee can put the data
             directly into the sequence so that no buffer reallocation is
             necessary.
             But this holds only when
             <ol>
              <li> neither caller nor callee keep a second reference to the same
                   sequence.
              <li> the sequence is pre-allocated with the requested number of bytes.
              <li> the same sequence is reused (simply preallocationg a new
                   sequence for every call bears no advantage).
              <li> the call is not bridged (e.g., between different compilers

             be negligible compared to a synchron call.
