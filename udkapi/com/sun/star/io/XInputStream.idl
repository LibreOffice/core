        <p>The return value specifies the number of bytes which have been
        put into the sequence. A difference between <var>nBytesToRead</var>
        and the return value indicates that EOF has been reached. This means
        that the method blocks until the specified number of bytes are
        available or the EOF is reached.  </p>
       @param aData
             after the call, the byte sequence contains the requested number
             of bytes (or less as a sign of EOF).

             <p>
             C++ only : Note that for unbridged (e.g., in-process)
             calls, using the same sequence for repetive readBytes()-calls
             can bear a performance advantage. The callee can put the data
             directly into the sequence so that no buffer reallocation is
             necessary.
             But this holds only when
             <ol>
              <li> neither caller nor callee keep a second reference to the same
                   sequence.
              <li> the sequence is pre-allocated with the requested number of bytes.
              <li> the same sequence is reused ( simply preallocationg a new
                   sequence for every call bears no advantage ).
              <li> the call is not bridged (e.g., betweeen different compilers
                   or different processes ).
             </ol>

             If the same 'optimized' code runs against an interface in a different process,
             there is an unnecessary memory allocation/deallocation (the out parameter
             is of course NOT transported over the connection), but this should
             be negligible compared to a synchron call.
