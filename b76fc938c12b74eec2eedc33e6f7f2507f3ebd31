      "message": "I\u0027 not convinced of this change, even if tm_tm_year is int (for historical reasons) it respectively the functions using it and converting to time_t can\u0027t all take a negative year, at least not guaranteed on all systems, can they? It is always documented as \"years since 1900\".\n\nSummary of the following: if we allow tm_year to become negative, should we forbid values \u003c -1899 ?\n\nhttp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n2058.html suggests that negative values may be valid in general but also states\n\n\"\nNote\n\nMost implementations of date input/output in current standard libraries accept and correctly handle tm_year with negative values. For example, tm_year \u003d\u003d -1 logically corresponds to 1899. Recently one implementation made a recent change by that prohibited negative tm_year values. The author has not been able to find anything in the standard or otherwise that specifies how negative values of tm_year should be handled. This may need to change to support portable implementations going forward.\n\"\n\nhttps://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2011-06/msg00193.html says \"POSIX documents that tm_year \u003c -1899 produces unspecified results, since year 0 does not exist in the Gregorian or Julian calendar.\"\n\nhttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/strftime.html says \"The ISO C standard allows tm_year to assume values corresponding to years before year 1, but the use of such years provided unspecified results.)\"\n\nhttp://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/time.h.html in the informative section says \"tm_year is a signed value; therefore, years before 1900 may be represented.\"",

      "message": "Also, even if mktime would return -1 for negative tm_year (and thus osl_getTimeValueFromDateTime return false) or handle negative tm_year correctly, pDateTime-\u003eYear - 1900 would lead to undefined behaviour for very small values, which the original condition would nicely prevent (not that it would probably matter in practice, though)",
