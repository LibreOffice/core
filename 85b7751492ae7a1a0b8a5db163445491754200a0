For another, there may be legitimate cases that a dlopen is failing due to an undefined symbol in osl_loadModuleAscii?  (I think, ultimately the right fix will be to change the sanitizer implementation in Clang to not implicitly link against symbols from the executable and require -z undefs, but explicitly link against some sanitizer runtime dynamic library.)",
