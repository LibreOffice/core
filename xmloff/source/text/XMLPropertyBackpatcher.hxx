/** This class maintains an OUString->sal_Int16 mapping for cases in
 * which an XPropertySet needs to be filled with values that are not
 * yet known.
 *
 * A good example for appropriate use are footnotes and references to
 * footnotes. Internally, the LibreOffice API numbers footnotes, and
 * references to footnotes refer to that internal numbering. In the
 * XML file format, these numbers are replaced with name strings. Now
 * if during import of a document a reference to a footnote is
 * encountered, two things can happen: 1) The footnote already
 * appeared in the document. In this case the name is already known
 * and the proper ID can be requested from the footnote. 2) The
 * footnote will appear later in the document. In this case the ID is
 * not yet known, and the reference-ID property of the reference
 * cannot be determined. Hence, the reference has to be stored and the
 * ID needs to bet set later, when the footnote is eventually found in
 * the document.
 *
 * This class simplifies this process: If the footnote is found,
 * ResolveId with the XML name and the ID is called. When a reference
 * is encountered, SetProperty gets called with the reference's
 * XPropertySet and the XML name. All remaining tasks are handled by
 * the class.
