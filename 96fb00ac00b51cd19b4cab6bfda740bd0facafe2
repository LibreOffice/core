      "message": "No twice makes no sense to me :-). With 0707380f05d4cce2d17eb74c4b871dcf17d3ac1f I tried to make the save indicator always visible. But you found an issue on gtk3/svp and removed the mandatory flag at Icd1fbefdd8f1be73b511d6ca0d13d6362f6a5509. Realized this after submitting and cherry-picking, so the question is whether the problem still exists.",

      "message": "From my experience, unit tests don\u0027t work well with gtk3. I\u0027m not really sure what svp is, I think it has to do with headless operations. I have used it before but I can\u0027t recall for what purpose. The vcl documentation says “svp” stands for “StarView Plugin”. As long as Jenkins passes and the local unit test SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN\u003dgen make JunitTest done from the tookkit directory passes, I think no problem exists that stops this patch from being merged.",
