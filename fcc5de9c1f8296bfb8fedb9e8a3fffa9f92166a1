Now they will have to enter all of the numbers before changing to currency format. So data entry will seem poorer. Of course, the easy workaround would be to delete the selected text before setting formatting.",

Keeping the current behavior is having such inconsistency - you have format different from data, and have to workaround that on filter level.\n\nBut in any case, please only consider my opinion as just a personal opinion, not something blocking you in any way :-) It\u0027s great how you deal with this!",
