      "message": "All that table styles do is to keep the table formatted after cell insertion (mostly important for styles with banded rows). If you disable this, then table styles become useless (compared to a one-time AutoFormat). My understanding is that we do want the formatting on insertion, we just don\u0027t want it to override manual formatting.",

      "message": "Let\u0027s take the \"Box List Blue\" style as an example. It has different formatting for a header row, a sum row, odd and even rows. The issue is that inserting a row will inevitably change the role of other rows as well. For example, if you insert a row in the middle of the table, then rows below it that used to be odd rows, now becoming even, and vice versa. Or if you insert a row at the bottom of the table, then the row above it is no longer a sum row. The purpose of a table style is to keep the formatting of a table consistent, by following cell role changes.",
