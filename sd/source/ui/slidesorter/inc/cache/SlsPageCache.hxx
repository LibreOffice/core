/** The page cache is responsible for the creation and storage of preview
    bitmaps of pages that are shown by the slide sorter.

    <p>Bitmaps for previews and a cache are used to speed up the display
    (painting) of the slide sorter.  But, of course, we have to limit this
    time-space-tradeoff by limiting the amount of space that can be use to
    store bitmaps.</p>

    <p>There are several strategies employed by this class to shorten the
    perceived time that is used to paint the slide sorter:
    <ul>
    <li>Rendering pages ahead of time.  Additionally to rendering the
    visible slides we try to render part or all of the slides that are not
    (yet) visible.  This, of course, makes sense only when the computer is
    ohterwise idle while doing that.</li>
    <li>When the size of the slides on the screen changes we mark the
    bitmaps as needing an update but use them while the new bitmap in the
    correct size is not available.</li>
    <li>Give the UI the chance to handle user events between the rendering
    of differe slides.</li>
    <li>Limit the amount of space that may be used for storing preview
    bitmaps and throw.</li>
    </p>

    <p>There is another somewhat similar methods for requesting new previews:
    GetPreviewBitmap() schedules a re-rendering (when necessary) and
    returns the preview what is currently available, either as a preview of
    the preview or, when nothing has changed since the last call, as the
    final thing.
