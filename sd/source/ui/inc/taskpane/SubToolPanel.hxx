    differes in two points.  First, it is a control that can be used
    as element in a tool panel and thus is actually a nested tool
    panel.

    <p>Secondly, it formats its elements differently.  The actual controls
    are placed one below the other with a title bar above each control.
    Clicking on the title bar expands or collapses the control.  When there
    is not enough space then scroll bars are shown.</p>

    <p>To avoid flickering when painting the sub tool panel the background
    is made transparent and painting it is done by this class.  While
    layouting its children it remembers the gaps between children and stores
    them in maStripeList.  In Paint() those gaps as well as the border
    around all children are painted in the background color.</p>
