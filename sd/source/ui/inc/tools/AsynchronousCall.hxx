/** Store a function object and execute it asynchronous.

    The features of this class are:
    a) It provides a wrapper around a VCL Timer so that generic function
    objects can be used.
    b) When more than one function objects are posted to be executed later
    then the pending ones are erased and only the last one will actually be
    executed.

    Use this class like this:
    aInstanceOfAsynchronousCall.Post(
        ::std::bind(
            ::std::mem_fun(&DrawViewShell::SwitchPage),
            pDrawViewShell,
            11));
