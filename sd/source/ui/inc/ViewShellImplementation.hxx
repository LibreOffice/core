        We can not use the view of that class because with the introduction
        of the multi pane GUI we do not switch the SfxViewShell anymore when
        switching the view in the center pane.  The view id of the
        SfxViewFrame is thus not modified and we can not set it from the
        outside.

        The view id is still needed for the SFX to determine on start up
        (e.g. after loading a document) which ViewShellBase sub class to
        use.  These sub classes--like OutlineViewShellBase--exist only to be
        used by the SFX as factories.  They only set the initial pane
        configuration, nothing more.

        So what we do here in essence is to return on of the
        ViewShellFactoryIds that can be used to select the factory that
        creates the ViewShellBase subclass with the initial pane
        configuration that has in the center pane a view shell of the same
        type as mrViewShell.
