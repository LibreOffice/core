    and sub shells on the SFX shell stack.  They form a two level hierarchy
    (the underlying ViewShellBase, the only true SfxViewShell descendant,
    forms a third level.)  On the first level there are the view shells
    (what formerly was called view shell, anyway; nowadays they are derived
    from SfxShell) and shells for panes. On the second level there are sub
    shells (also derived from SfxShell) that usually are tool bars.

    <p>On the SFX shell stack the regular sub shells are placed above their
    view shells.  The FormShell is a special case.  With the SetFormShell()
    method it can be placed directly above or below one of the view
    shells.</p>

    <p>Shells managed by this class are created by factories or are given
    directly to Activate... methods.  For the sub shells there is one
    factory for every view shell.  Factories are added or removed via the
    (Add|Remove)SubShellFactory() methods.  The FormShell is managed with the
    factory of its view shell.</p>
