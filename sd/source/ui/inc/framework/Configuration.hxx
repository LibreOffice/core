/** A configuration describes the resources of an application like panes,
    views, and tool bars and their relationships that are currently active
    or are requested to be activated. Resources are specified by URLs rather
    than references so that not only the current configuration but also a
    requested configuration can be represented.

    A resource URL describes the type of a resource, not its actual
    instance. For resources, like panes, that are unique with respect to an
    application frame, that does not mean much of a difference. For other
    resources like views, that may have more than one instance per
    application frame, this is different. To identify them unambiguously a
    second URL, one of a unique resource, is necessary. This second URL is
    called the anchor of the first. The two types of resources are called
    unique and linked respectively.

    Direct manipulation of a configuration object is not advised with the
    exception of the configuration controller and objects that implement the
    XConfigurationChangeOperation interface.
