/** Manage the set of visible tool bars (and object bars).  Usually they
    belong to the current view in the center pane.

    Tool bars are managed in groups.  Each group can be set, reset, or
    modified independently of the others.  This allows for instance to
    replace the toolbars associated with the current function independently
    from those associated with the main view.

    The ToolBarManager has two high level methods which contain the
    knowledge about which tool bars to show in a specific context.
    When the view in the center pane changes then MainViewShellChanged()
    sets up the tool bars for the new view.  On changes of the selection the
    SelectionHasChanged() method shows the tool bars for the new context.

    The update of the actually visible tool bars to the set currently
    required by the main view shell and its functions is divided into two
    parts, PreUpdate() and PostUpdate().  This are to be called before
    respectively after the update of the view shell stack.  The reason for
    this is to save time by not updating tool bars that will not be visible
    in a short time on a view shell switch.
