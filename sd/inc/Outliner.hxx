/** The main purpose of this class is searching and replacing as well as
    spelling of impress documents.  The main part of both tasks lies in
    iterating over the pages and view modes of a document and apply the
    respective function to all objects containing text on those pages.

    <p>Relevant objects: There are two sets of objects to search/spell
    check.  One is the set of all selected objects.  The other consists of
    all objects on all pages in draw-, notes-, and handout view as well as
    slide- and background view (draw pages and master pages).</p>

    <p>Iteration: Search/replace and spelling functions operate on shapes
    containing text.  To cover all relevant objects an order has to be
    defined on the objects.  For the set of all selected objects this order
    is simply the order in which they can be retrieved from the selection
    object.<br>
    When there is no selection the order is nested.  The three modes of the
    draw view are on the outer level: draw mode, notes mode, handout mode.
    The inner level switches between draw pages and master pages.  This
    leads to the following order:
    <ol>
    <li>draw pages of draw mode</li>
    <li>master pages of draw mode</li>
    <li>draw pages of notes mode</li>
    <li>master pages of notes mode</li>
    <li>draw pages of handout mode</li>
    <li>master pages of handout mode</li>
    </ol>
    Iteration starts at the top of the current page.  When reaching the end
    of the document, i.e. the last master page of the handout mode, it jumps
    to the first draw page of draw mode.  In backward searches this order is
    reversed.  When doing a <em>replace all</em> then the whole document is
    searched for matches starting at the first page of the draw/slide view
    (or last page of handout/background view even though search
    direction).</p>

    <p>The start position is restored after finishing spell checking or
    replacing all matches in a document.</p>

    <p>Some related pieces of information:
    The search dialog (<type>SvxSearchDialog</type>) can be controlled in
    more than one way:
    <ul><li>A set of option flags returned by the slot call
    SID_SEARCH_OPTIONS handled by the
    <member>SdDrawDocument::GetState()</member> method.</li>
    <li>The contents of the search item of type
    <type>SvxSearchItem</type>.</li>
    <li>The <member>HasSelection()</member> view shell method that returns
    whether or not a selection exists.  However, it is called from the
    search dialog with an argument so that only text selections are
    queried.  This is only sufficient for searching the outline view.
