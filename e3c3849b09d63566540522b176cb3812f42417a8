Again.\n\nI have no objection to use iodbc *if* you do it correctly (aka with fixing the build with system-iodbc) and make it consistent. That is why I commented on this issue in the first place before I saw it was on a collabora change.\n\nAlso possible is to check for both unixodbc and iodbc although that might create build failurews if one of them changed header behaviour...\n\n\u003e  though I imagine iODBC is packaged for Debian -\n\n... which I even referenced ...\n\n\u003e and that we could just use that instead of unixODBC as a trivial drop-in replacement and share this.\"\n\nTrue.\n\nThe -2 was purely for that technical carelessnes, not a general \"no, don\u0027t do that\".",
