If problems arise, we could easily add it again.\n\nI personaly would comment it out, adding a tdf#143114 and why it\u0027s commented out explanation and may need reactivation, but I learned that some people just remove things like that and argue that it\u0027s in the git history if needed, so I no longer do that...\n\nI do not understand your 2nd comment - you talk about renaming the *CheckCtrl methods? I see no need there..?",
