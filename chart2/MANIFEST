makefile.mk
-----------

The top-level makefile is for generating a jar-file containing all compiled
java-files that were generated from the chart-idl files.  The jar is necessary
for test-programs (see qa subdirectory)

prj
---

Contains the build.lst, which determines in which order the subdirectories have
to be built.

Also contains the d.lst which tells the deliver command which files to export
into the output tree, so that other modules have access.  These are currently
only C++-headers of project-specific UNO-classes.

source
------

   inc
   ---

   Contains header files that have to be shared between files of model, view and
   controller.  Apart from tools-headers, this should only include headers for
   model objects, not view objects.

   controller
   ----------

   Contains files concerning the controller.  All dialogs used in the UI of the
   component are in the dialogs subfolder.  In drawinglayer, there is code that
   builds the bridge to the drawing-layer via non-UNO code.  Itemsetwrapper
   offers classes that convert XPropertySets of chart objects into non-UNO
   SfxItemSets that are used to feed dialogs.

   model
   -----

   Contains files concerning the model.  In oldapi there is code that implements
   the old UNO-API (com.sun.star.chart.*) and wraps the new objects, thus it is
   possible to talk to the new objects via the old API.  Until the XML-filter is
   adapted to the new API it will use this wrapper to communicate via the old
   API.

   In the tree-subfolder, there are all classes that have to do with the
   data-series tree provided by the XDiagram.  Template contains code that
   provides templates for all different chart-types.

    view
	----

	Axes, charttypes and diagram implement the respective view-objects.

drafts
------

Contains idl files for chart specific idl interface and type definitions.

util
----

Contains the makefile to assemble the idl files into an rdb, and to generate C++
headers for them.

workbench
---------

Contains files for testing and files needed during prototyping.

    officeintegration
    -----------------

    Contains the install.pl script that installs the chart once it is build into
    an existing office installation.  This should become deprecated soon, when
    the new chart will be a package.


   sampledata
   ----------

   Contains sample files of data to feed a chart with.  The files are loaded via
   the FileDataSource and is thought for testing only.

   stub
   ----

   Contains some templates for newly created files.

genjava
-------

Contains a makefile for creating java-files out of the idl-files.  The
java-files are generated out of the chart.rdb, which therefore must be ready
before this makefile is called.

Its subdirectories reflect the directory-structure of the drafts/com directories
and contain a makefile in each leave of the tree.  These makefiles compile
class-files out of the java-files.

qa
--

Contains java-programs that execute so-called complex-testcases.  Type dmake in
this directory to build the tests (they are not automatically built) and then
type dmake runtest to execute all tests.  For most tests you will have to have a
running office in the background that listens to requests on port 8100.
