/*
Use this Guard in your ApiCalls to protect access on resources
which will be released in dispose.
It's guarantied, that the release of resources only starts if your
guarded call has finished.
! It's only partly guaranteed that this resources will not change during the call.
See the example for details.

This class is to be used as described in the example.

If this guard is used in all api calls of an XCloseable object
it's guarantied, that the closeable will close itself after finishing the last call
if it should do so.

  ::ApiCall
{
    //hold no mutex!!!
    LifeTimeGuard aLifeTimeGuard(m_aLifeTimeManager);

    //mutex is acquired; call is not registered

    if(!aLifeTimeGuard.startApiCall())
        return ; //behave as passive as possible, if disposed or closed

    //mutex is acquired, call is registered
    {
        //you might access some private members here
        //but than you need to protect access to these members always like this
        //never call to the outside here
    }

    aLifeTimeGuard.clear(); //!!!

      //Mutex is released, the running call is still registered
    //this call will finish before the 'release-section' in dispose is allowed to start

    {
        //you might access some private members here guarded with your own mutex
        //but release your mutex at the end of this block
    }

    //you can call to the outside (without holding the mutex) without becoming disposed

    //End of method -> ~LifeTimeGuard
    //-> call is unregistered
    //-> this object might be disposed now
}

your XComponent::dispose method has to be implemented in the following way:

    ::dispose()
{
    //hold no mutex!!!
    if( !m_aLifeTimeManager.dispose() )
        return;

    //--release all resources and references

}
