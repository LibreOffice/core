      "message": "Yep you are right. I tried a test file using 1M rows and it took 2 mins to open it with the flag and \u003e10mins (I aborted it) without the flag. Should I insert some threshold, where this flag will be unset? I think about 1k rows. Or maybe do you have a different idea how to solve this issue?",
