      "message": "As ODFF 6.7.8 (SEARCHB) says under semantics \u0027As SEARCH, but using byte positions\u0027 and ODFF 6.20.20 (SEARCH) says under semantics \u0027The values returned may vary depending upon the HOST-USE-REGULAR-EXPRESSIONS or HOST-USE-WILDCARDS properties. (3.4)\u0027 I simply used ScSearch as a starting point and made sure that all unit test calls for SEARCH give the same result with SEARCHB.\n\nSo I tested with regular expressions, but not with wildcards, as SEARCH does not work well in Calc with them:\nSEARCH( \"f?ce\"; \"LibreOffice\"; 1 ) returns 10 (8 expected),\nSEARCH( \"f.ce\"; \"Libreoffice\"; 1 ) returns 8 as expected.\nWith Excel it is the other way round:\nSEARCH( \"f?ce\"; \"LibreOffice\"; 1 ) returns 8 as expected),\nSEARCH( \"f.ce\"; \"Libreoffice\"; 1 ) returns 10 (8 expected.\nSEARCHB is the same as SEARCH in both Calc and Excel.\n\nI have no idea how to (dis)able regexpr/wildcards in Calc or Excel.\n\nNow you know what I did and why, and that Excel supports wildcards.",
