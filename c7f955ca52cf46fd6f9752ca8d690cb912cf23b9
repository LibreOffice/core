Originally I wanted to avoid any text conversation by Qt. Preferring utf8 over unspecified \"text/plain\" would definitely be an improvement too.\n\nI have no idea, what the real minimal Qt 5 requirement is. We still compile with qt5_minimal_minor\u003d\"6\". No idea what Qt 5 is used for the TDF builds.\n\nYour mentioned patch is in Qt 5.13 … hmmm. LO could do the utf-8 conversation itself. ",

LO could do the utf-8 conversation itself. \n\nI was thinking about that as well, but since it primarily appears to be relevant for Wayland in practice, I thought that requiring Qt \u003e\u003d 5.13 should be OK (Qt \u003c 5.13 lacking a lot of probably critical fixes for Wayland anyway).\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t have a strong opinion here. Do you think we should handle that in LO instead?",
