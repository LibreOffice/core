Originally I wanted to avoid any text conversation by Qt. Preferring utf8 over unspecified \"text/plain\" would definitely be an improvement too.\n\nI have no idea, what the real minimal Qt 5 requirement is. We still compile with qt5_minimal_minor\u003d\"6\". No idea what Qt 5 is used for the TDF builds.\n\nYour mentioned patch is in Qt 5.13 â€¦ hmmm. LO could do the utf-8 conversation itself. ",
