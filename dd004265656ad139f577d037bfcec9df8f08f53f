      "message": "I didn\u0027t spend much time on this yet, as I was mainly working on Qt, where the following test now works:\n\n- start LO\n- maximize window\n- close LO\n- start LO \u003d\u003e window is maximized\n- un-maximize \u003d\u003e window has original position and size\n\nThis is basically tdf#125543; lot of VCL changes for a single bug...\n\nThe update needs to be made to WinSalFrame::SetWindowState to follow the same \"workflow\" then the QtFrame implementation. My \"vision\" is to have some SalFrame based function with new APIs to get/set the WindowState and otherwise use SetPosSize. Won\u0027t happen before tdf#125543 is resolved on all platforms.",
