And in any case it shouldn\u0027t crash current implementation, at worse results are odd.",

      "message": "This works for me if you wish, I don\u0027t see any real reason why we\u0027d want to allow `nEndIndex` \u003e `nStartIndex`.  The only potential use for this I see would be allowing the caller to choose which end they prefer if they can\u0027t have both (e.g. if the bounding box doesn\u0027t fit in the view): we would always prefer nStratIndex, whether it\u0027s greater or not then nEndIndex, allowing to select the other end by swapping the arguments.\nBut that\u0027s not a feature of the API, so it\u0027s probably stretching it a bit too far.  And this could be relaxed in the future anyway, while adding restrictions is trickier.",
