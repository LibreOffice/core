      "message": "I was thinking that QrCodeGenDialog::GenerateQRCode could possibly be also converted to a standalone utility function (and thus removed from the class interface). That is, of course, a task for a *separate* unrelated change, but that would mean that we will need to move that function *above* QrCodeGenDialog::Apply; and then we would also need to move *this one* up there, too.\n\nSo, since you will have to fix the includes and XML that I pointed to, could you please also move the whole namespace up to the beginning of this file, right above QrCodeGenDialog::QrCodeGenDialog (below those \"using\")? That would allow us to avoid future moves of this utility function, if that becomes necessary.",
