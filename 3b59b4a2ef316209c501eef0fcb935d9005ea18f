I only have one expired, and it failed here locally; this indeed allows to pass the tests, but I can\u0027t verify that it doesn\u0027t effectively disable the test for all.",

      "message": "What do you think about having this next to unotest::MacrosTest::setUpNssGpg(), and then both tests could call the new unotest::MacrosTest() function to do this check? Otherwise good to hear you have an idea how to solve this. :-)\n\nThe Linux case completely ignores \"system\" signing certificates during tests, so you are not breaking them with this change, I think.\n\nI\u0027m not familiar with the windows case, but if this change is needed, then I assume we have a layered approach there if filter/qa/pdf.cxx already calls MacrosTest::setUpNssGpg() and you still have a problem.",
