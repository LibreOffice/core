      "message": "using the XPathAPI is great, but this setDocumentReference is perhaps not so ideal...\n\nmaybe try to pass only the sequence of XML-DOMs to the domain-mapper?\n\nwhat if you refactor resolveCustomXmlStream(rStream); call out of OOXMLDocumentImpl::resolve() and call it directly in WriterFilter::filter() and then get the XML-DOMs and pass them to domain-mapper...\n\nor, set them in the XModel already, but apparently they go into a grab-bag with a bunch of other things... maybe those could be moved in a similar way?\n\nah no, this is all too complicated: why not just change resolveCustomXmlStream which gets the DomainMapper as a Stream parameter to call a new function on Stream that takes the list of XML-DOMs - then implement it in DomainMapper to store the list somewhere.",
