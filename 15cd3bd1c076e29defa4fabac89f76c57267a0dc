      "message": "I\u0027m puzzled why you would suggest this.  The table menu is closely physically located to character and paragraph formatting, both of which open up with comprehensive, tabbed properties. I would think that the main item a user would be looking for in format tables would be the similar, comprehensive table properties - thus it has the most prominent position.\n\nAren\u0027t the most popular items put on the top of the menu? Cell functions would seldom be used. They were only included for completeness.",
