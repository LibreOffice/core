How to write a canvas test:
===========================

The easiest (relatively speaking) way is to copy&paste from somewhere. Use existing tests
as the base, or canvas/workben/canvasdemo.cxx should be a good source too. If that doesn't
help, then you'll need to find the right UNO interfaces (see canvas/README). Have "fun".


Currently only the vclcanvas implementation is tested, because it's the only one
capable of working with offscreen surfaces. Other implementations would need to
be fixed, and then added to the gb_CppunitTest_use_components list in the makefile.
