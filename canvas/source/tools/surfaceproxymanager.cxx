            draw this image using any kind of graphics api you want.
            in the technical sense we allocate some space in local
            videomemory or AGP memory which will be filled on demand,
            which means if there exists any rendering operation that
            needs to read from this memory location.  this method
            creates a logical hardware surface object which uses the
            given color buffer as the image source.  internally this
            texture may be distributed to several real hardware
            surfaces.
