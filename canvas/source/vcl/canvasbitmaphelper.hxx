        Note that a plain CanvasHelper, although it does support the
        XBitmap interface, has no provision for alpha channel on VCL
        (at least no efficient one. If the alpha VDev one day gets
        part of SAL, we might change that).

            This method late-initializes the bitmap canvas helper,
            providing it with the necessary device and output
            objects. The internally stored bitmap representation is
            updated from the given bitmap, including any size
            changes. Note that the CanvasHelper does <em>not</em> take
            ownership of the SpriteCanvas object, nor does it perform
            any reference counting. Thus, to prevent reference counted
            objects from deletion, the user of this class is
            responsible for holding ref-counted references to those
            objects!

            @param rBitmap
            Content of this bitmap is used as our new content (our
            internal size is adapted to the size of the bitmap given)

            Reference device for this canvas bitmap

            @param rOutDevProvider
