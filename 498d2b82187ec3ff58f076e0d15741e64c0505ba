      "message": "Yes, we need some limitation to avoid copying the character formatting of the last portion, if that paragraph is not imported from a DOCX file. I suggested to Bal√°zs to limit this based on the zero length of the last portion: if I right know, only in the case of paragraphs imported from an DOCX file there is a zero length terminating text portion which contains the paragraph-length character formatting for the newly inserted table rows.\n\nThe reverted commit 2ab481b038b62b1ff576ac4d49d03c1798cd7f84 \"tdf#90069 DOCX:\nfix character style of new table rows\" and this replacement are about the run-time table row insertions after the import, so likely we cannot use IsInWriterfilterImport() here.",
