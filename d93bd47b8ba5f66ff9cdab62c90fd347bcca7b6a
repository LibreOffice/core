      "message": "That\u0027s abusing nOriginalLang (which was never meant for this context but the LCID embedding).\n\nBut why is that LocaleDataWrapper unreliable? It was created in MSWordExportBase::GetNumberFormat() (which creating a temporary LocaleDataWrapper for each and every formatted field is ugly anyway) for the locale of rField.GetLanguage(), it looks (didn\u0027t investigate) like there is a mismatch of the field locale (system locale?) and the number format\u0027s locale (German?). Maybe it helps already to use a proper LocaleDataWrapper, like\n\n  LocaleDataWrapper aLocDat(pNFormatr-\u003eGetComponentContext(),\n          LanguageTag(pNumFormat-\u003eGetLanguage()));",
