So in the end this isn\u0027t strictly necessary, although it shouldn\u0027t be incorrect to have it here and does avoid one more loop. I guess the question is what should happen if ALL of the remaining rows are short... I hadn\u0027t thought of that. I guess the only way to know would be a unit test example and see how WORD handles it.",
