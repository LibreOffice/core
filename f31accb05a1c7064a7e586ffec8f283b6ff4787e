      "message": "i dont\u0027t think this works: the counter m_nAutoMarkIdx always increases but both this call here and user\u0027s text delete actions may delete marks, so there is no guarantee that the index corresponds to the expected mark, and neither is there a guarantee that the index is smaller than the size of the vector.\n\nif we want to delete the oldest set mark, why not number the marks consecutively (this is already done?) and then always delete the lexicographically first one?\n\nalthough, since we\u0027re sorting strings, the sort function needs to sort e.g. __Mark__10 after __Mark__9...",

I tried this approach before but for some reason abandoned it. Here is another go at it in Patch Set 4 https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/86256 - It makes for no need of m_nAutoMarkIdx and works correctly when reminders are deleted when maximum reminders are reached and for user text delete actions that include reminders.\n\nThe wrapping messages need to be made specific to reminder navigation which follows the order set, not document position order.",
