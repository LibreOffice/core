      "message": "while LO itself doesn\u0027t use the uwinapi DLL under MSVC 2015, it is still being built and included in the install set for the rationale given in \u003chttps://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id\u003d0c9ddb24ee0388d03c313caf5a45f1aa26049781\u003e \"Don\u0027t redefine snprintf as VS 2015 supports ISO standard\": \"Investigation reveals that the GetShortPathNameW is presumably used by legacy Duden extension that was built by Sun in a setsolar environment. The uwinapi.lib was never part of the SDK, so ordinary extensions cannot link against it.\"\n\nSo I suggest to decouple actual removal of uwinapi from this change, and discuss it elsewhere.",

      "message": "Just to check my understanding:\n\n* 1. LO doesn\u0027t need it. So we can still remove that define from all make files\n*. 2. We are not sure, if someone in the wild still need that feature, so that uwinapi should still be included in the install set\n\nIs that correct? So basically remove from every place, but build it and still include in the install set?",
