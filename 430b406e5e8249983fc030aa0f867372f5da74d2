      "message": "I changed that when I was wondering why my code failed with a nullptr (symbol build with asserts). For the mirroring we have to clone the value, based on the ControlType.\n\nAnd you have to implement this for your new type. Otherwise all the static_casting \"value\" code would have to check nullptr. If you get here in a release build you\u0027re out of luck.\n\nMaybe there should actually be an abstract cloneMirrored() function in these objects...\n\nOTOH I have no hard feelings changing it to assert(false);",
