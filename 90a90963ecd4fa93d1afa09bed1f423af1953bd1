      "message": "I don\u0027t think so - I keep thinking about it, and start to believe that it should not be sixed, at least that would not be easy, and would likely be a breaking change.\n\ntdf#107953 was about specific problem - displaying in IDE debugger. The change there attempted to make more general change, and it made *some* difference (although not the full expected result, it still increased precision from 14 decimals to maximal 15, which is why there was a visible result).\n\nHowever, the rest should be IMO still be bound to debugger (if at all). And here we should just state the current status.",

If we used 17 digits, it would not be rounded to 691.2 - but the code rounds it to 15 decimals.\n\nThe change that you did recently to try to force 17 decimals looks not doing its job (and the code in sal/rtl/math.cxx indeed has the 15 hard-coded, irrespective of passed nDecPlaces unfortunately.)",
