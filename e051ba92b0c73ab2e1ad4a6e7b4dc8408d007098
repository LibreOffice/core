Perhaps it is also header?  Somewhere it suggested that GetLeft is always better than GetMaster.\nThis needs a bit more investigation...",

      "message": "Yes, this is just supposed to get the LEFT HF for either the right or left page style. No problem there.  But GetFirstLeft() is better - since we (almost) always show the first header in these circular page-follows. [Wow - this just bends the mind in knots.]\n\n(The exception is if the very first page is a left page (aka page 2) - at which point LO doesn\u0027t actually show the first page, but shows the Left() page.  Rather strange, and probably a bug in its own right.)",
