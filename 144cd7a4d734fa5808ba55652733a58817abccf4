      "message": "Caveat, theoretically there can be empty index slots if a ScRangeData was erased from the map and the index wasn\u0027t reused, as findByIndex() finds the ScRangeData index, not a positional index. So it should be checked if findByIndex(i) returned nullptr. \n\nAlso, pRangeName-\u003esize() does not have to equal the maximum index used if ScRangeData was erased. However, this may work here because during import ScRangeData are only added and a comment should state that circumstance. It would be cleaner though to obtain the highest possible index as ScRangeName::maIndexToData.size()+1 (would need a new getter function as maIndexToData can\u0027t be accessed).",
