The DuplicateHandle documentation says that desired access must go to the dwDesiredAccess parameter, while I asked you to put it here (to dwOptions, which should be zero in this case, because we don\u0027t want neither same access, nor close original handle).\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t think we need PROCESS_DUP_HANDLE right, because we don\u0027t duplicate the resulting handle anywhere. It\u0027s original handle that must have this right, so that function succeeds.",
