With --invisible there is no UI, so collaboration would be quite challenging ;-)\n\nI think with a proper Listen/Unlisten implementation we do not need a command line option at all, or do we? A \"listen always\" option instead should go into the user configuration at the end, IMHO.",

      "message": "The idea is that we have our service registered by .service file and Channel Dispatcher calls ./soffice --invisible. LibreOffice then accepts channel, file, open it, and there is UI.\nAlso it could work if we already run LibreOffice without registering but I did not try it yet.\n\nI\u0027ve left the Listen option for the case if we don\u0027t have .service file.\nAnd I did not want registering to be default because you can register only once and then get errors with second LibreOffice running.",
