(perhaps hard to do when everything is new and foreign).\n\nFor example, see one of my (shorter) commit messages at https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/113986",

      "message": "What is this supposed to do? It doesn\u0027t look right to me.\n\n[Oh, I see - it is adapted from a comment I made in the bug report. The comment was just there to indicate that a FillStyleItem was already created - and that the default (unspecified) value for that is SOLID - which is why we see a SOLID colour - the colour XFillColorItem   (aNullStr,aNullFillCol). Normally I would expect a default fillstyle to be NONE, but that isn\u0027t true in this case, which is why we see the problems. But it would be VERY DANGEROUS - in terms of breaking other people\u0027s code - to change the default value, so instead we are just assigning a NONE in cases that still need it.]\n\nIn any case, this is either wrong, or else it does nothing. It certainly is different looking than all the other initialized defaults in this file (which is a good clue).",
