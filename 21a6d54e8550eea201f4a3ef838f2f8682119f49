This is a very special case, because you have to run some code in the main thread, while holding the SolarMutex, but we\u0027re processing all SendMessage messages this way. Can this be a problem, resulting in the deadlock?\n\nThis is all about the Windows version of \"RunInMain\", but probably it\u0027s not correctly implemented this way? ... have to think a bit more about it.",
