So I too think that it is OK to do an API CHANGE here and replace css.beans.QRCode with the new css.beans.BarCode (which also has to be published, for the same technical reasons).\n\nWhat you do in the latest patch set, however, is to keep offapi/com/sun/star/drawing/QRCode.idl (and mark its contents as deprecated) but not to build it anymore.  That doesn\u0027t make sense; either keep it as deprecated alongside the new css.beans.BarCode (which I would not suggest to do, see above), or drop it completely.",
