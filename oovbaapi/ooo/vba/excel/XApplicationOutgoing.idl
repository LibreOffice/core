// Despite being here in ooo::vba, this has nothing to do with "VBA" (Visual Basic for
// Applications), or the VBA compatibility in StarBasic. This is related to using LibreOffice from
// (OLE) Automation clients. It is here anyway because much of the API available to such clients
// is identical to that offered to StarBasic code written in a VBA-like fashion.

// This interface exists for technical reasons only, we don't actually have any UNO object that
// would implement (inherit from) this. We just advertise the type of this interface from Writer to
// the Automation-UNO bridge code (in extensions/source/ole) so that it can tell the Automation
// client what the Automation server expects and construct a corresponding COM interface that can
// receive the callbacks. Or something like that.
