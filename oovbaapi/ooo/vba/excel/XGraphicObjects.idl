    <p>The following sheet symbols represent collections of graphic objects,
    and therefore implement this interface:</p>
    <ul><li>Buttons: push button (command button) controls,</li>
    <li>ChartObjects: chart objects embedded in the sheet,</li>
    <li>CheckBoxes: check box controls,</li>
    <li>DropDowns: drop-down listbox controls,</li>
    <li>EditBoxes: text edit controls (dialog sheets only),</li>
    <li>GroupBoxes: group frame controls,</li>
    <li>GroupObjects: group objects containing other child objects,</li>
    <li>Labels: fixed text controls,</li>
    <li>ListBoxes: plain listbox controls,</li>
    <li>OptionButtons: option button (radio button) controls,</li>
    <li>Ovals: simple ovals and circles,</li>
    <li>Pictures: picture objects,</li>
    <li>Rectangles: simple rectangle objects,</li>
    <li>ScrollBars: scrollbar controls,</li>
    <li>Spinners: spinner (spin button) controls,</li>
    <li>TextBoxes: rectangle objects with embedded text.</li></ul>

    <p>These symbols are now deprecated in VBA but kept for compatibility with
    old VBA scripts. All symbols representing collections of form controls do
    NOT belong to ActiveX form controls but to the old-style drawing controls.
