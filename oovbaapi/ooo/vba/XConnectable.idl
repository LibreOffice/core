// Despite being here in ooo::vba, this has nothing to do with "VBA" (Visual Basic for
// Applications), or the VBA compatibility in StarBasic. This is related to using LibreOffice from
// (OLE) Automation clients. It is here anyway because much of the API available to such clients
// is identical to that offered to StarBasic code written in a VBA-like fashion.

// An object that implements this interface should intend to be usable from an Automation client
// that wants the object to do callbacks, i.e. generate "events" in the client (for instance
// implemented in VBScript, VB6, or even C++).
