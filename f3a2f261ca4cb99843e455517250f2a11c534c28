And any call with startdate on a Monday and enddate ion a Sunday will just have the int division by 7 as result, even if there are more days between startdate and enddate.\nTo avoid using week numbers and difficult calculations when crossing years, I simply remove the whole weeks between startdate and enddate, leaving just the comparison of the day of week.\n\nAnd to avoid different comparisons for startdate\u003c\u003denddate and startdate\u003eenddate, I calculate only with startdate\u003c\u003denddate and correct to negative value if the WEEKS argument have startdate\u003eenddate.\n\nI hope all this rambling is clear...",

      "message": "It\u0027s better to think not about number of \"week crossings\", but about substracting week numbers of the dates - where week numbers are taken from *any* given week treated as 0. The only important part here is calculating the correct week numbers.\nAnd it\u0027s very interesting to note, that 0001-01-01 was *Monday*. So given that in the code, date 0001-01-01 is 0, it\u0027s really trivial to count week number based on that date (call that week of 0001-01-01 \"week 0\") - it then doesn\u0027t need *any* \"zero date\" calculated/added to the two dates. Any your date\u0027s week number is simply std::floor(date/7.0). This is true for both date \u003e\u003d 0 and date \u003c 0: floor makes -0.01 round to -1.",
