And any call with startdate on a Monday and enddate ion a Sunday will just have the int division by 7 as result, even if there are more days between startdate and enddate.\nTo avoid using week numbers and difficult calculations when crossing years, I simply remove the whole weeks between startdate and enddate, leaving just the comparison of the day of week.\n\nAnd to avoid different comparisons for startdate\u003c\u003denddate and startdate\u003eenddate, I calculate only with startdate\u003c\u003denddate and correct to negative value if the WEEKS argument have startdate\u003eenddate.\n\nI hope all this rambling is clear...",
