      "message": "Have I guessed correctly that the keyboard accelerators in the File \u003e Properties - Statistics tab are not working because the _ was missing?\n\nBut why would any accelerator be shown without the underscore? Does the use_underline default to using the first letter, as well as notice \"conflicts\" (Characters vs. Characters excluding spaces)?",

      "message": "Accelerators are auto generated by the backends if there isn\u0027t already a suggested candidate indicated by _ in the .ui. Conflicts typically just mean the two widgets with the same accel are cycled between on each trigger of the accel.\n\nThe accelerators mostly don\u0027t work because it doesn\u0027t really mean anything to set a normal label as the target of an accelerator, a button can be activated, an edit can gain focus but a normal label can\u0027t do either so the accelerator has nothing it can do.\n\nThe \"Update\" button ironically is missing a \"use-underline\" so the one thing that could be activated here is missing the property to enable it, so we should definitely add that to Update at least. https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/134391\n\nThe bug report mentions that things work in the \"General\" tab and there we have some (rare) cases of labels that have the \"selectable\" property. That sound like the most favored, then the labels have something they could do, to select the contents of the selectable labels. That works for the gen backend.\n\n(But sadly gtk doesn\u0027t seem to like it, but it is arguable a sensible thing to do so I could try and submit it upstream as a bug/rfe for gtk to consider allowing that)",
