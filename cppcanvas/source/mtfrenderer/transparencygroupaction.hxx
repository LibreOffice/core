            This action groups a bunch of other actions, to be
            rendered with the given transparency setting against the
            background.

            Creates encapsulated converters between GDIMetaFile and
            XCanvas. The Canvas argument is deliberately placed at the
            constructor, to force reconstruction of this object for a
            new canvas. This considerably eases internal state
            handling, since a lot of the internal state (e.g. fonts,
            text layout) is Canvas-dependent.
