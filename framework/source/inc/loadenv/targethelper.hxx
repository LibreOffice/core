            @descr  Because we handle special targets in a hard coded way
                    (means we do not check the real name of a frame then)
                    such named frames will never be found!

                    And in case such special names can exists one times only
                    by definition inside the same frame tree (e.g. _beamer and
                    OFFICE_HELP_TASK) its not a good idea to allow anything here :-)

                    Of course we can't check unknown names, which are not special ones.
                    But we decide, that it's not allowed to use "_" as first sign
                    (because we reserve this letter for our own purposes!)
                    and the value must not a well known special target.

                    the new frame name, which should be checked.
