                a) If we recycle any existing frame, we must bring it to front.
                   Showing of such frame is not needed really.. because we recycle
                   visible frames only!
                b) If the document was already shown (e.g. by our progress implementation)
                   we do nothing here. The reason  behind: The document was already shown...
                   and it was already make a top window...
                   If the user activated another frame inbetween (because loading needed some time)
                   it's not allowed to disturb the user again. Then the frame must resists in the background.
                c) If the frame was not shown before... but loading of a visible document into this frame
                   was finished... we need both actions: setVisible() and toFront().

        @param  xWindow
                points to the container window of a frame.

        @param  bForceToFront
                if it's set to sal_False... showing of the window is done more intelligent.
                setVisible() is called only if the window was not shown before.
                This mode is needed by b) and c)
