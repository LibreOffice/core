/** @short  internal helper to bind e.g. MAC-Menu events to our internal dispatch API.

    @descr  On e.g. MAC platform system menus are merged together with some fix entries as
            e.g. "Pereferences" or "About". These menu entries trigger hard coded commands.
            Here we map these commands to the right URLs and dispatch them.

            This helper knows a frame and its container window (where VCL provide the hard coded
            commands). We hold those objects weak so there is no need to react for complex UNO dispose/ing()
            scenarios. On the other side VCL does not hold us alive (because it doesn't know our UNO reference).
            So we register at the VCL level as an event listener and
