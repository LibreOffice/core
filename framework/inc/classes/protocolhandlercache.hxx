                          can be used to get her other properties

                          perform search on such data
                    But this lists a static for all instances of this class. So it's possible to
                    create new objects without opening configuration twice and free memory automatically
                    if last object will gone.

    @attention      We implement a singleton concept - so we don't need any mutex member here.
                    Because to safe access on static member we must use a static global lock
                    here too.
