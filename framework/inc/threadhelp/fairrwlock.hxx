    @short          implement a read/write lock with fairness between read/write accessors
    @descr          These implementation never should used as base class! Use it as a member every time.
                    Use ReadGuard and/or WriteGuard in your methods (which work with these lock)
                    to make your code threadsafe.
                    Fair means: All reading or writing threads are synchronized AND serialzed by using one
                    mutex. For reader this mutex is used to access internal variables of this lock only;
                    for writer this mutex is used to have an exclusiv access on your class member!
                    => It's a multi-reader/single-writer lock, which no preferred accessor.
