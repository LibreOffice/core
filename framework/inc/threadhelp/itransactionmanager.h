    @descr          Describe different states of a feature of following implementation.
                    During lifetime of an object different working states occur:
                        initialization - working - closing - closed
                    If you wish to implement thread safe classes you should use this feature to protect
                    your code against calls at wrong time. e.g. you are not full initialized but somewhere
                    call an interface method (initialize phase means startup time from creating object till
                    calling specified first method e.g. XInitialization::initialze()!) then you should refuse
                    this call. The same for closing/disposing the object!
*//*-*************************************************************************************************************/
enum EWorkingMode
{
    E_INIT       ,   // We stand in a init method   -> some calls are accepted - some one are rejected
    E_WORK       ,   // Object is ready for working -> all calls are accepted
    E_BEFORECLOSE,   // We stand in a close method  -> some calls are accepted - some one are rejected
    E_CLOSE          // Object is dead!             -> all calls are rejected!
};

    @descr          If a request was refused by a transaction manager (internal state different E_WORK ...)
                    user can check the reason by using this enum values.

    @descr          A transaction object should support throwing exceptions if user used it at wrong working mode.
                    e.g. We can throw a DisposedException if user try to work and our mode is E_CLOSE!
                    But sometimes he dont need this feature - will handle it by himself.
                    Then we must differ between some exception-modi:
                        E_NOEXCEPTIONS          We never throw any exceptions! User handle it private and looks for ERejectReason.
                        E_HARDEXCEPTIONS        We throw exceptions for all working modes different from E_WORK!
                        E_SOFTEXCEPTIONS        We throw exceptions for all working modes different from E_WORK AND E_INCLOSE!
                                                This mode is useful for impl-methods which should be callable from dispose() method!

                                                e.g.    void dispose()
                                                        {
                                                            m_aTransactionManager.setWorkingMode( E_BEFORECLOSE );
                                                            ...
                                                            impl_setA( 0 );
                                                            ...
                                                            m_aTransactionManager.setWorkingMode( E_CLOSE );
                                                        }

                                                        void impl_setA( int nA )
                                                        {
                                                            ERejectReason       EReason;
                                                            TransactionGuard    aTransactionGuard( m_aTransactionManager, E_SOFTEXCEPTIONS, eReason );

                                                        }

                                                Normaly (if E_HARDEXCEPTIONS was used!) creation of guard
                                                will throw an exception ... but using of E_SOFTEXCEPTIONS suppress it
                                                and member "A" can be set.
