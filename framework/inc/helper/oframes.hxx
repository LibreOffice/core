                    The framecontainer is a member of it from type "FrameContainer". That means;
                    we have the same information as our owner. In current implementation we use mutex and lock-mechanism
                    to prevent against compete access. In future we plan support of semaphore!

    @ATTENTION      Don't use this class as direct member - use it dynamically. Do not derive from this class.
