The original expression was comparing\n\n  o3tl::make_unsigned(nDeltaSec) \u003e 1 + ( pTSource-\u003epInstance-\u003em_nTimeoutMS / 1000 )\n\nYour modified expression was (incorrectly) comparing\n\n  o3tl::make_unsigned(nDeltaUSec) \u003e 1000000 + ( pTSource-\u003epInstance-\u003em_nTimeoutMS / 1000 )\n\nThe difference was that first one added seconds to seconds, and your was adding microseconds to seconds. You added many lines, instead of just making your comparison expression add microseconds to microseconds.",
