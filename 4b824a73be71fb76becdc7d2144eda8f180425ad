      "message": "Or, this is indeed correct (as nParamCount was decremented in the overall while() but nothing popped), but confusing.. rather Pop() before (i.e. move the bTextAsZero Pop() outside the if/else) and then keep this loop as is.\n\nIn the end it didn\u0027t hurt as a result is pushed and Interpret() restores the stack (but just had to unnecessarily pop and push the result).",
