      "message": "Hmm, you are right.\n\nFirst of all, it should be a separate change.\nI wanted to avoid the absolute patch substituted from autoconf, where possible. Currently, when there\u0027s such a path, I don\u0027t see if that was builddir, or sourcedir - they are the same in my setup, but semantically different. I also wanted to be able to change them in one place in the workspace, and have the effect throughout the uses of that variable.\n\nI know that I can just add user variables to the workspace into settings ( https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53206904/vscode-custom-variables-in-launch-settings ), and refer to those instead of pre-defined {workspaceFolder:foodir}. But that would introduce warnings in the workspace.\n\nAlso I could bale instdir/workdir just use {workspaceFolder:builddir}/hardcoded_dir_name. That should be OK, but is it future-proof?\n\nOr I can of course revert to fixed paths throughout the workspace - something I would like to avoid.\n\nWhat would you suggest as a follow-up fix?",
