# OpenCL Support

OpenCL-related code that is not specific to any particular
functionality OpenCL is used for. (Like formula group calculation in
Calc.)

Not compiled on platforms where OpenCL is not available (iOS and
Android). On other platforms OpenCL is optional at run-time, but not
at build time.
