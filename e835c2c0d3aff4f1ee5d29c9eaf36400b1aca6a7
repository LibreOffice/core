      "message": "Hi Xisco,\ni will re-examine the problem, again. I have written crash but this is not a really crash, because writer works, only hangs, because when the shape is selected and you try to scroll down it does not work. (This was in the ticket if i remember well) So crash is not correct i will change it. Locally when i checked the test, without the fix it stopped with fatal exception/segfault if i remember well, with the fix it passed, so there should be a much better solution to check this, so if you have any suggestion i will accept it. Thanks.",
