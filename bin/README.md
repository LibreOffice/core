# Tools and Non-Build Scripts

Tools and scripts mostly not used during the build

This direction has a number of key pieces (?) that are used during the
build, or are simply generally useful. One example is

    bin/find-german-comments <directory>

which will try to detect and extract all the German comments in a
given source code hierarchy `/` directory.
