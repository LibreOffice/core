So the flow is unclear:\n\u003e \n\u003e 1. What problem the counter solves? The message does not explain that, only mentions an alternative - again, to solve what is left unsaid.\n\nSo the imagined scenario is:\n- normal window\n- maximized window, normal saved: 1\n- full-screen maximized window: 2\n- un-fullscreen \u003d\u003e maximize: 1\n- minimize: 1\n- normal : 0 \u003d\u003e restore position\n\nThinking about it again, it\u0027s easier to just cache the state and compare it to the current state. I wanted to have some common \"facility\", but maybe this is making everything more complex then needed...\n\nIn the end we just need to save/keep the normal position and size, while in any other none-normal state.\n\n\u003e 2. Why can\u0027t we call refOrSavePosSize unconditionally, tolerating the counter values greater than 2? (I *guess* that the save/restore calls indeed do not follow a strict order, but would then the value of 2 be safe?)\n\nMy original idea was, minimize and maximize are \"stack 1\" and full-screen is \"stack 2\", so you can actually have a WindowState of \"Maximize | Fullscreen\", where going back from Fullscreen restores Maximize (or Minimize). Starting a Fullscreen presentation from a Maximized Impress definitely happens, but OTOH the Fullscreen Impress window is separate, so it\u0027s actually a non-problem here.\n\nThe refcounter going to zero indicates, we should restore the normal size and clear the saved normal position and size.",

It feels I spend more time thinking about it then actually coding (but not waiting on full recompiles of LO when changing the tools::Rectangle on Linux and Windows...)\n\nI\u0027m not sure what your question really is, but this should be handled just fine.\n\nIt comes down to:\n\n\u003e For me the WindowState is represented by:\n\u003e - the normal position and size\n\u003e - the current non-normal state (full-screen | maximized | minimized / iconfified)\n\nWe need to save the position and size when we leave \"normal\" and restore it, when we enter normal. The saved \"normal\" is required when we quit LO, so we can correctly restore the window to it\u0027s original position and size and the restore the state. Actually most of the state transitions are done by the OS, so VCL must report the current state but keep the \"normal\" state updated.\n\nThis is all about fixing tdf#125543 in the end.",

      "message": "That\u0027s everywhere. The general consensus seems to be, that:\n- maximized \u003d window has frame, restricted areas (taskbar etc) are respected, position and size differ from screen size\n- full-screen \u003d window has no frame, whole screen is covered. There are actually two full-screen modes in LO VCL: a single screen in covered or the whole \"virtual\" multi-screen is covered.\n\nBut this doesn\u0027t matter for my implementation. It will have saved the \"normal\" position and size and report the current position and size and the WindowState. I don\u0027t think there is anything else needed. If a user restores LO on a different screen maximized, old maximized values are bogus. The \"normal\" position might be insufficient now too, but there is already code in place to fix that (I didn\u0027t verify, it actually works).\n\nI honestly don\u0027t understand the intention of your comment, but maybe this shows my point. Do I need to update the commit message to make it more clear? Any suggestions?",
