      "message": "I think trying to address false warnings in --enable-optimized GCC builds is just not worth it, esp. since which false warnings exactly get emitted with exactly which -O settings appears to be a moving target in GCC.  (For example, my current GCC 12 trunk LO test build is littered with various temporary local\n\n  #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Warray-bounds\"\n  #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Wstringop-overflow\"\n\npatches across the code base, to allow it to build---though none at the location addressed here.  Some of them may become obsolete when a stable GCC 12 is released, some of them will keep being annoyance for longer, new ones will almost inevitably arise.)  I think the only sane approach, if one is not into reporting introduction of new false warnings to the GCC developers, is to combine --enable-optimized with --disable-werror when building with GCC.",
