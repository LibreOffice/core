      "message": "This is wrong:  The original code apparently assumes that m_pImpl-\u003epCurrentEntry is not set (and \"warns\" if that is not the case; it is unclear without further investigation whether that OSL_ENSURE should translate to an assert, a SAL_WARN_IF, or a SAL_INFO_IF).  Adding code to return early if the expected condition (that m_pImpl-\u003epCurrentEntry is not set) is true changes the behavior of the function.",
