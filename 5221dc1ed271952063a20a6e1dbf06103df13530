It implements many other interfaces; you may want to add XPropertySet to the set of interfaces listed in SfxLibraryContainer_BASE, and implement its virtual methods in SfxLibraryContainer; the setPropertyValue should only accept one property name (e.g., \"VBAProjectCodePage\"), and set corresponding field in it; other methods may be simply stubs throwing \"NoSupportException\".\n\nDoes it make sense?",
