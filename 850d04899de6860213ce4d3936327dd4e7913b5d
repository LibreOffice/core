      "message": "For DOC export, writeExpand just output plain text. So this is especially important for that format.\n\nFor DOCX it is still outputting as fields. The change here only affects DI_CUSTOM, which seems to output fine as DOCX/RTF fields even when not exported via writeExpand. (At first I was restricting it to just DOC format, but when I checked into DOCX/RTF I found out that writeExpand wasn\u0027t needed here.)",
