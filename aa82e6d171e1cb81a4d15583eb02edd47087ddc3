      "message": "Thanks a lot Julien.\n\nWell, in the end I re-did the patch from scratch.\nI guess something went wrong with my git-rerere config.\n\nWell, I keep a clean master branch, the one with my notes/patches (not possible to merge, but to avoid to re-submit), and each time I create a new patch I snapshot the clean master (well, I snapshot/update/force head of remote original server), in a complete new tree.\n\nMy brain today is out.\n\nThanks a lot for your help.",
