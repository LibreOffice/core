I think there is a problem with the dispatcher when i try to add a textbox via UNO command. For details see: https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/125808\nBut a good thing (maybe), if the dispatcher is fixed the test is in this patch so it is enough to uncomment it have to work. In that case if better to remove, of course i do it.",
