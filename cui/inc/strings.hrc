/* To translators:
   Please, try to find a similar *short* translation to avoid
   to get narrow "New" field in the "Edit custom dictionary" window,
   for example, "Model word for optional affixation and compounding"
   is too long, but "Grammar By" is a good name here (help page of
   the window contains the details).

   "Grammar By" text entry box of the "Edit custom dictionary" window
   contains an optional model word associated to the new user word,
   allowing its affixation or compounding during spell checking.
   For example, adding "Grammar By" word "fund" to the new user
   word "crowdfund", the spell checker will recogize "crowdfund"
   with suffixes of "fund": "crowdfunding", "crowdfund's" etc.
