# This file contains all dialogs that the unit tests in the module
# will work on if it is in script mode. It will read one-by-one,
# try to open it and create a screenshot that will be saved in
# workdir/screenshots using the pattern of the ui-file name.
#
# Syntax:
# - empty lines are allowed
# - lines starting with '#' are treated as comment
# - all other lines should contain a *.ui filename in the same
#   notation as in the dialog constructors (see code)

# in registerKnownDialogsByID/createDialogByID

# No known dialogs in cui for now

# Dialogs without a hard-coded representation. These will
