      "message": "so it turns out that Yield is not enough, since it only dispatches the first highest priority idle task, and not all of them.\n\nso plan B is to add a own Idle task for the test with a low priority, and then loop around Yield until that Idle is invoked.\n\nthat means using the Idle class from \u003cvcl/idle.hxx\u003e, use the SetPriority() to set it to e.g. LOWEST, LOWER or LOW and SetIdleHdl to give it a callback function and then Start() to activate it.\n\nthe callback function should be defined with DECL_LINK_TYPED and IMPL_LINK_TYPED, take an Idle* parameter,  and you need to add a little class with a boolean flag member that is then flipped by the callback.\n\nthen after starting the Idle, break out of the loop around Yield if the flag in the Idle is set.",
