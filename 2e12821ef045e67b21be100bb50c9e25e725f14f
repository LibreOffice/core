      "message": "This changes GlobalSheetSettings from a \"new-style\" service (which will have a constructor in the UNO language bindings, see e.g. uses of css::sheet::GlobalSheetSettings::create in the LO C++ code) to an \"old-style\" one (which lacks the constructor).  Having to manually modify offapi/type_reference/offapi.idl is always a sign that one is doing something fishy.\n\nBetter document in a comment that the implementation of this service will optionally provide (via XPropertySet or wahtever) access to a boolean \"PrintSingleJobs\" property.  (If that is what actually is implemented; I didn\u0027t check that.)",
