The below doesn\u0027t seem like it is quite right. \n\nIf I cd to external/poppler_data and use make, the files are deployed (or cleaned, etc) as expected. But if I run make from the top level directory, it\u0027s like the makefile in external/poppler_data never gets called.\n\nI appreciate any advice that can be provided. I\u0027m not familiar with the gbuild system and it has been a bit frustrating trying to figure some of this stuff out.",
