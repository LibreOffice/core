      "message": "This probably could be LR_TB as a default, which would quickly eliminate a lot of processing. The result would be one less hard-coded \"default\" property. But I left it in, just in case it is useful in RTL contexts (though my testing suggests it isn\u0027t needed - but what do I know about RTL?). Plus, any failure in value-acceptance will lead to the previous behaviour, so a non-regression move.\n\nI guess it is better to leave it this way for this patch, and then do a separate patch to set to LR-TB default if we want to speed this up, to help isolate a regression.",
