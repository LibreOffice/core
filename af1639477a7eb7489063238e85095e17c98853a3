      "message": "This is done to reset all parent-child relationships because user is dragging the parent of an expanded list of effects, we initially re-parented all children to the 1st child. This must be undone in the case of the user cancelling the drag, so a simple minded solution is to just rebuild the list when drag finishes.\n\nRather than doing a mpMainSequence-\u003erebuild(), I could iterate through all effects and correct any incorrect parent relationships. This would likely execute faster, but add extra code Impress. \n\nWould it be better to write a routine that does just what we need, or stick with fully regenerating the list of effects?",
