      "message": "i don\u0027t like this at all... it\u0027s very confusing that the pHdl is *sometimes* a owning pointer and *sometimes* not.\n\nthis will also break as soon as somebody changes the \"new\" in controlpropertyhdl.cxx without updating this function which is in a completely different file.\n\nthis \"new\" was added in commit 56d069fd47a5938ef2aa611f855d41fee30f3538 and i think it should just be converted to a \"unique_ptr\" member like all the other handlers created by that function, that would make things consistent and fix the leak.",
