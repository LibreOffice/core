      "message": "I think MergeCharacterBorder expect pNext to be a valid text portion, or at least not a para portion. pNext \u003d\u003d pPor ignores the test. I wonder why this works for tdf#126353. I forgot the exact test cases, but if you insert tabs after the subscripts in the test document of tdf#126353, you get broken brders , another regression.",

      "message": "pNext is pFirst when pNext\u003d\u003dpPor. So the rule probably changes in the case of the very first portion.\n\nPerhaps you need to add something like\npPrev \u003d (rInf.GetLast() \u0026\u0026 !pPor-\u003eIsParaPortion()) : ...\n\nor could you simply say if ( !pPrev || !pNext-\u003eIsParaPortion() )\n\nto prevent merging borders between two paragraphs?\nUnfortunately there were no test documents attached to tdf#8722, so I can\u0027t really do any test scenarios, and I don\u0027t really understand what your original patch was trying to do anyway. Hopefully this gives you a good head-start on a fix though.",
