Of course, seeing unit tests commented out looks scary in a diff \u003d) but - if they are all new tests anyway, then presumably that\u0027s no problem - particularly if a subsequent patches un-comments them.\n\nGlad to see more tests getting written: assuming that is that they exercise code paths that are actually used in LibreOffice. Nailing down all details of our API whether they are un-used or not would not be good. We really don\u0027t want to sacrifice flexibility for the sake of making VCL a general purpose library \u003d)\n\nSo - I guess that\u0027s a +1 from me assuming that each test is testing something that is in live use \u003d)",
