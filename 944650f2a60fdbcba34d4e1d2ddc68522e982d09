But this prop was only added recently to master with 67600fe5c9380bdb3eb26809a6475eae30a23231 \"tdf#67770: Config for remembering the last active deck\", so no real users\u0027 UserInstallation should be poisoned.  Only developers who ever ran code that wrote this prop back should clean up their UserInstallation.",
