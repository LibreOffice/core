      "message": "This loop should be moved into the one above for each range, so if there is a mismatch then the GetNotesInRange() doesn\u0027t need to be executed for all following ranges.\n\nActually it may be better to create a new functions that dive into Tab/Col levels similar to what GetNotesInRange() does, to bail out very early instead of gathering all notes, specifically because this is called for large All-The-Sheet ranges to only collect the overall state.",

      "message": "This should not be squeezed into the FID_SHOW_ALL_NOTES / FID_HIDE_ALL_NOTES state handling, for which a call to AreAllNoteCaptionsShown() is unnecessary. Unless we want to disable those slots if already all notes are shown or hidden, but then AreAllNoteCaptionsShown() needs further enhancement to return three states AllShown/AllHidden/Mixed and I\u0027d leave that part out for another change. Until then please use a different case block.",
