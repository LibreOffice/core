This decision is meant to handle files that have a long list of changes to show.\n\nBasically, if I use \"-1\" for height, the dialog will expand beyond the visible area in the sidebar. However, setting a fixed height solves the issue, because then the large number of items in the dialog will not cause the dialog to expand.\n\nIdeally what I would like to do is make the dialog always use all the available height in the sidebar (as the Styles sidebar does). However I could not figure out how to do it. Let me know if you have any suggestions on how to achieve this.",
