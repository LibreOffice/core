      "message": "This is hard to debug, as a bad sURI will merely trigger a actual\u003d0 vs. expected\u003d1 CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUAL failure, instead of stating the actual and expected URI values.  If the five URIs are guaranteed to appear in a specific order in pAnnots-GetElements(), it would be better to check for them with string-comparing CPPUNIT_ASSERT_EQUALs.\n\n(In a similar vein, I wonder if it wouldn\u0027t be better for maintainability and debuggability to programmatically construct a document here, instead of loading a pre-canned one, even though that appears to be a common pattern for all the tests in this source file.)",
