      "message": "In several places in this patch (or rather, the code you\u0027re patching), we see not just a swap, but the following logic: \"if the second element should come before the first element, then swap them\". I suggest you write a function to do just that. It\u0027s essentially sorting two elements, but you obviously don\u0027t want to invoke std::sort for two elements... so maybe a `sort_pair()` or whatever, which takes two lvalue references and a comparator defaulting to std::less?",
