      "message": "@Samuel: Hi, I\u0027ve created a recursive approach to add subfolders as categories(region) too. But, the case of identifying a folder is never reached (see bIsFolder). I am not sure why it is behaving like this. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out but it\u0027s still not clear.\n\nI think the recursive approach should work and I tried to debugging it by removing the conditions.. i think line 1575 is never executed correctly :( \n\nHelp needed :-)",
