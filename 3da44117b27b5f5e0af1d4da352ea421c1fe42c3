      "message": "This patch maybe need some discuss. \nThese changes solve the problem of view data in a date field control in most databases, which usually date range goes from 1/1/0001 to 31/12/9999, but still maintains limits on the range of dates that can be viewed. \nA solution that removes all limits would be better, but I am not able to implement it without help.\nIn any case, the patch extends the range of supported dates to dates before 1/1/1600, which in my opinion is too limiting date, and on the other side it extends the range so that it allows to enter the \"magic\" date 9/9/9999 which is widely used by database users as the \"end of the world\" date (the forever date in ranges from-to).\nThis patch could solve too tdf#150587 extending the limits of \"Date min\" and \"Date max\" to more reasonable limits",
