Therefore we do not change such files. You can write your new lines of code in clang format but please keep all other lines untouched.",

      "message": "In addition to what Regina said, this change in this form is completely unreviewable. It isn\u0027t clear which lines are changed functionally, and which are simply re-formatted.\n\nI don\u0027t even know where to start looking for the problem in the failing test.\n\nBy the way, answering the IRC\u0027s \"any tips on how to fix this?\": start with splitting this to several separate single-file commits. Then on the one that fails, you debug the failing test, and see which is the actual value tested with some expected one; and adjust the expected one.",
