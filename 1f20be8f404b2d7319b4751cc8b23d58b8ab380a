      "message": "The MSVC branch has always failed to set HAVE_THREADSAFE_STATICS\u003dTRUE for the below AC_SUBST, which wasn\u0027t a problem because the only use of that var was in GCC-only solenv/gbuild/platform/com_GCC_defs.mk.  But if it is now also used in solenv/gbuild/platform/com_GCC_defs.mk, that would cause -Zc:threadSafeInit- to be used even in cases where it should not be (x64 build with \u003e\u003d 2015).",
