      "message": "This is where my patch set starts falling into the weeds. Things start to look \"different from MS\". The biggest issue is what happens when NO formatString is provided - allowing the application to make the decision. Well, making that decision in a similar way to MS is defeating me (in the following patch).\nOnce this part is figured out, then the remaining two patches can fairly easily move forward.",

And leave the no-format-string case unchanged. That would provide benefit to most users while not breaking the edge case. Would that work?",
