      "message": "Switching to string_view here doesn\u0027t avoid any temporary objects.  Creating an OUString from a char const* via static OUString::createFromAscii isn\u0027t much different from creating one from a std::u16string_view via the relevant OUString constructor.  (The situation would be different if we could use OUStringLiteral for Sm[Color]TokenTableEntry::pIdent, but which is blocked, at least for now, by OUStringLiteral being a template.)\n\nThis Gerrit change is already enough of a mixed bag of things.  I think I would just leave the type of SmColorTokenTableEntry::pIdent alone, at least for now.",
