But so far at least the dBase example set also bRet\u003dtrue for that case.\n\nOdd might be that the overflow occurred with binary .xls test documents, because the older BIFF formats don\u0027t support more than 256 columns, so for a broken or crafted document an error may have been appropriate.. unless those are BIFF8, which knows 16k columns as well.\n",

I\u0027m confused why you say \"warning or data loss\", it\u0027s both. When we load such Excel files, we cut the data and show the warning. Current master even without this patch, to be clear.\n\n\u003e Odd might be that the overflow occurred with binary .xls test documents, because the older BIFF formats don\u0027t support more than 256 columns, so for a broken or crafted document an error may have been appropriate.. unless those are BIFF8, which knows 16k columns as well.\n\nThe filter selected is \"MS Excel 97\", so it is presumably BIFF8.",
