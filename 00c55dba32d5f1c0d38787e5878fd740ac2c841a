      "message": "Yes, they grow from 1, but they are not continous. We can just have two redlines in the document, and the second redline will have a much larger identifier. Using a 16 bit sounds good when they were array indices (and continous), but one could quite easily exhaust all of it in current approach, hence I bumped the type.",
