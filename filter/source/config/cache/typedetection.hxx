        @descr      It steps over all flat detected types (given by the parameter lFlatTypes),
                    try it and search for most suitable one.
                    The specified MediaDescriptor will be patched, so it contain
                    the right values every time. Using of any deep detection service
                    can be enabled/disabled. And last but not least: If the results
                    wont be really clear (because a flat detected type has no deep
                    detection service), a "suggested" type name will be returned as "rLastChance".
                    It can be used after e.g. all well known deep detection services
                    was used without getting any result. Then this "last-chance-type"
                    should be returned. Of course using of it can fail too ... but it's a try :-)

                    As an optimization - this method collects the names of all used deep
                    detection services. This information can be useful inside the may be
                    afterwards called method "impl_detectTypeDeepOnly()"!

        @param      rDescriptor
                    provides any easy-to-use stl interface to the MediaDescriptor.
                    Note : Its content will be adapted to returned result of this method.
                    Means: The type/filter entries of it will be actualized or removed from it.

        @param      lFlatTypes
                    a list of all flat detected types, which should be checked here.
                    No other types are allowed here!

        @param      rLastChance
                    the internal name of a "suggested type" ... (see before)
                    Note: it will be reseted to an empty string every time. So
                    a set value of "rLastChance" can be detected outside very easy.

        @param      rUsedDetectors
                    used as [out] parameter. It contains a list of names of all deep
                    detection services, which was used inside this method.

                    is called.

                    enable/disable using of a might existing deep detection service.
