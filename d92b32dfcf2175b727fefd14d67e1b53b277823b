      "message": "Reinterpret cast mappings between pointers and integers are implementation-defined (with only a round-tripping guarantee if a pointer is cast to a sufficiently large integer type and back).  Therefore, I would suggest explicitly sticking to the time-tested idiom of only casting between pointers and sal_[u]IntPtr (aka std::[u]intptr_t).",
