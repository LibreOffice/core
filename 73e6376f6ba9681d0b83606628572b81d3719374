      "message": "I must had been explicit last time. What I wanted to ask was \"what is the idea behind the specific change in this line\".\n\nBecause what I see is you simply rename the macro, without any functional change. And so the change here is simply cosmetic. I haven\u0027t in fact checked the macro code; so do you say that the macro was already doing export-only testing, and so the rename makes it clear? or otherwise why do you believe that renaming the macro is adequate for the task?",
