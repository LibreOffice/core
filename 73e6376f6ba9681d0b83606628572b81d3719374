      "message": "I must had been explicit last time. What I wanted to ask was \"what is the idea behind the specific change in this line\".\n\nBecause what I see is you simply rename the macro, without any functional change. And so the change here is simply cosmetic. I haven\u0027t in fact checked the macro code; so do you say that the macro was already doing export-only testing, and so the rename makes it clear? or otherwise why do you believe that renaming the macro is adequate for the task?",

      "message": "So the change seems to be:\n\n1. Rename the macro from DECLARE_LINKS_EXPORT_TEST to DECLARE_LINKS_EXPORT_EXPORTONLY_TEST, likely to make its name akigned with names of related macros in other tests; the macro itself already only tested \"export-only\" case - see that line 58 declares \"Import_Export_Import\" test, and there\u0027s no \"Import\" test like present in e.g. DECLARE_SW_ROUNDTRIP_TEST from sw/qa/inc/swmodeltestbase.hxx;\n\n2. Remove the useless and wrong checks for null return from parseExport from relevant tests.\n\nIn fact, that is what *you* should had written in the *commit message* to describe what you did. I tried to give you some hints, but ended up doing this (most important in this change!) job myself :-(.",
