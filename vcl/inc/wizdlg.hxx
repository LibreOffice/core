    /** wizard for a roadmap

        The basic new concept introduced is a <em>path</em>:<br/>
        A <em>path</em> is a sequence of states, which are to be executed in a linear order.
        Elements in the path can be skipped, depending on choices the user makes.

        In the most simple wizards, you will have only one path consisting of <code>n</code> elements,
        which are to be visited successively.

        In a slightly more complex wizard, you will have one linear path, were certain
        steps might be skipped due to user input. For instance, the user may decide to not specify
        certain aspects of the to-be-created object (e.g. by unchecking a check box),
        and the wizard then will simply disable the step which corresponds to this step.

        In a yet more advanced wizards, you will have several paths of length <code>n1</code> and
        <code>n2</code>, which share at least the first <code>k</code> states (where <code>k</code>
        is at least 1), and an arbitrary number of other states.

            and after this, you finish in state <code>5</code>.<br/>
            Now if the first path is active, and your current state is <code>1</code>, then you can
            easily switch to the second path, since both paths start with <code>(0,1)</code>.<br/>
            However, if your current state is <code>2</code>, then you can not switch to the second

                conflicts exists, the path is not completely activated, but only up to the point
                where it does <em>not</em> conflict.<br/>
                With the paths in the example above, if you activate the second path (when both are
                already declared), then only steps <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> are activated,
