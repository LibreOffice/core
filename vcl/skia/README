This is code for using the Skia library as a drawing library in VCL backends.
See external/skia for info on the library itself.

Environment variables:
======================

See README.vars in the toplevel vcl/ directory. Note that many backends do not
use Skia. E.g. on Linux it is necessary to also use SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN=gen .

There are also GUI options for controlling whether Skia is enabled.

Skia drawing methods:
=====================

Skia supports several methods to draw:
- Raster - CPU-based drawing (here primarily used for debugging)
- Vulkan - Vulkan-based GPU drawing, this is the default

There are more (OpenGL, Metal on Mac, etc.), but (as of now) they are not supported by VCL.
