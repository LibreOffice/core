This is code for using the Skia library as a drawing library in VCL backends.
See external/skia for info on the library itself.

Environment variables:
======================

SAL_DISABLESKIA=1 - force disabled Skia
SAL_ENABLESKIA=1 - enable Skia, unless blacklisted (and if the VCL backend supports Skia)
SAL_FORCESKIA=1 - force using Skia, even if blacklisted
SAL_SKIA=raster|vulkan - select Skia's drawing method, by default Vulkan is used

There also also GUI options for controlling whether Skia is enabled.

Note that many backends do not use Skia. E.g. on Linux it is necessary to also use
SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN=gen .

Skia drawing methods:
=====================

Skia supports several methods to draw:
- Raster - CPU-based drawing (here primarily used for debugging)
- Vulkan - Vulkan-based GPU drawing, this is the default

There are more (OpenGL, Metal on Mac, etc.), but (as of now) they are not supported by VCL.
