The menu can be a floating window, or a menu bar.  Even though this has
'Window' in the name, it is not derived from the VCL's Window class, as the
MenuFloatingWindow's or MenuBarWindow's already are VCL Windows.

TODO: move here stuff that was a mentioned previously when there was no
common class for MenuFloatingWindow and MenuBarWindow:

// a basic class for both (due to pActivePopup, Timer,...) would be nice,
// but a container class should have been created then, as they
// would be derived from different windows
// In most functions we would have to create exceptions for
// menubar, popupmenu, hence we made two classes
