Hacked up prototype of atk bridge


Serious problems
    + Threading/locking:
	+ incoming CORBA calls & the GDK lock
		+ how are these being processed & on what thread ?
		+ are we holding the GDK_THREADS lock ?
		+ can we even do that ?
		+ is it really necessary to be thread safe ?
		+ how does this work in combination with the (unsafe) GAIL code ?
		+ what should incoming CORBA calls be doing ?
			+ esp. since we can't tell if they're coming from
			  in-proc or not either [ though this is unlikely ]


Test:
	+ in-line text editing, does the TEXT_CHANGED signal get it right,
	+ why not copy/paste/delete etc. ?
		+ check vs. writer & other bits ...
	+ AtkSelection
	+ AtkHyper*

* At-poke
	+ implement non-gui mode - for to-console event logging
	+ logging
		+ more detail from remaining events
	+ add a Tree navigation thing instead (?)
		+ poke a sub-child (?)
		+ embed a tree widget inside the tree view ?
	+ AtkHyperText testing (?)


Known bugs:
	+ AtkText
		+ selection interface - multiple selections ?
		+ word boundary issues
			+ copy AccessibleTextImpl.java's getAfterIndex eg.
	+ the 'getFoo' methods need to use UNO_QUERY_THROW &
	  throw an exception to avoid null pointer dereferences.
	+ AtkAttributeSet (etc.)
	+ AtkEditableText
	+ finish/test AtkTable
	+ HyperLink 'link_activated', HyperText 'link_selected' (?)
	+ tooltips create new toplevels with broken roles.
