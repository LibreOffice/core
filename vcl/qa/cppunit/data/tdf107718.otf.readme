This is a subset copy of Source Han Sans font licensed under Open Font License and
obtained from (the Static Super OTC):

  https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-sans/releases/tag/2.004R

And subset using hb-subset to contain only the one glyph used in the test:

  hb-subset SourceHanSans.ttc --face-index=25 --unicodes="u4E16,u1109,u1168,u11BC,u302E,uC185,u0020" -o tdf107718.otf

U+C185 is not directly used in the test but we need its glyphs. The space is
added to the subset as it seems needed to get the font to work on Windows.
