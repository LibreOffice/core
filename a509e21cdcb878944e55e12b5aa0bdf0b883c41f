      "message": "ne_uri_parse splits the URI into its parts. IIUC, the problem is unescaped characters in the path part of the URI, which is ne_strndup\u0027ed into ref.path in the function, so could be first unescaped using ne_path_unescape (thus putting all bytes from %20 into spaces in resulting string along with those umlauts unchanged), then escaped back using ne_path_escape (thus putting both previously-escaped spaces and previously-unescaped umlauts to escaped form). Could that solve the problem, if the two calls (and required cleanup) done between current lines 181 and 182 of src/ne_207.c? Would that avoid the need in more massive changes?",
