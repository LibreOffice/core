      "message": "All this listener code was introduced with 4c93c341be1425401112eed3581e8b8a6308880d to fix tdf#88398 when a group is split. EndListeningIntersectedGroup() actually works only on this one position. If the string forms a formula merging into a group, setting up those listeners is handled deeper down. Stepping through StartNeededListeners() in these cases confirmed that indeed no listener is marked needed and calling the function is superfluous.",
