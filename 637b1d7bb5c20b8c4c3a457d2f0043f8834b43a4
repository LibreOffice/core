      "message": "Removing this is wrong. This changes how the test is executed: currently, lines above this check are executed, including number of charts test, on both passes, and only the part below is 2nd-pass-specific. Your change removes all checking in the first pass.\n\nAs I wrote to Onur YÄ±lmaz about similar case in https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/85826/3/sw/qa/extras/ooxmlexport/ooxmlexport6.cxx#b449 , you could just change the check from testing result of parseExport *after* its execution to testing mbExported *before* the call, but keep the unit test running for both passes.",
