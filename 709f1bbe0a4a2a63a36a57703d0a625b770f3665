Additionally, doing it only conditionally would fail your assumption below, where you create string_view with a fixed increment of 2.\n\nAnd you only need that size \u003d 1 \u003c aBufLength, because then you are free to put something to buf[size + 1], and you don\u0027t care if there\u0027s a null at buf[size + 2], since you will define the length explicitly.",
