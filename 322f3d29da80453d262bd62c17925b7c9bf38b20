      "message": "This would not be correct - you need to skip the opening parenthesis first, then spaces (this change would skip either one or the other, consuming \"url\" without \"(\").\n\nBy the way, the original skip_char(..., \u0027(\u0027) was also wrong - it doesn\u0027t require that there is the character, it just skips it *if* it\u0027s present. You need to replace the \"url\" with \"url(\", to require that there is the character right after it; use startsWithIgnoreAcsiiCase, and then skip whitespace - which includes space, tab, CR (so we likely need a skip_char with arbitrary number of characters - e.g., taking std::initializer_list\u003csal_Unicode\u003e).",
