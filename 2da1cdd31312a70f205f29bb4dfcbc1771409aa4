This might be unimportant, and indeed the rule of thumb is to not rely on a variable state after the move.",

I tried this when making the function inline, and this only simplifies the C++ code, but the generated code is actually worse (IIRC resize() of mdds_vector creates an additional loop that runs destructors on all the original null strings).\n\n",
