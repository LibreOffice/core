It\u0027s a small file with just a few defines. I guess config_global.h will be available almost everywhere anyway, but this way seemed more correct.",

That\u0027s why I used global over features. If you don\u0027t change your OS / libc the dl-API won\u0027t change. In that case you very likely need to recompile everything anyway.",
