      "message": "Thanks for the comments! The reverts for 7.2 are now in in libreoffice-7-2 (7-2-2 is pending).\n\nI have removed the ruby.fodt change from this patch.\nIt actually contained two changes to the original test file (I remembered wrong previously):\n- add grid via \"Format \u003e Page Style \u003e Text Grid\", select \"Grid (lines only)\",\n- change font size to 44.\n\nThe grid was based on the description of tdf#144122, and the size change was based on Shinji\u0027s test document.\nAnd yes, this file should exhibit the issues from both bug reports.",

      "message": "Looks good to me for master. Moving to SwTwips has the positive effect that the unit is now clear. This is a mass-conversion, so I think it\u0027s fine to leave the test for tdf#144122 to a separate follow-up change. If you need help, please upload what you have so far to gerrit and I\u0027m happy to take a look. Thanks.",
