The reverts for 7.2 are now in in libreoffice-7-2 (7-2-2 is pending).\n\nI have removed the ruby.fodt change from this patch.\nIt actually contained two changes to the original test file (I remembered wrong previously):\n- add grid via \"Format \u003e Page Style \u003e Text Grid\", select \"Grid (lines only)\",\n- change font size to 44.\n\nThe grid was based on the description of tdf#144122, and the size change was based on Shinji\u0027s test document.\nAnd yes, this file should exhibit the issues from both bug reports.",
