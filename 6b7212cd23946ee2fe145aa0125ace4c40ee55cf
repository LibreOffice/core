      "message": "The original \u003chttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1738\u003e \"Uniform Resource Locators (URL)\" (on which our INetURLObject was traditionally based) did not allow for any user:password@ part in http URLs (see section 3.3 \"HTTP\").  And while harmonization and generalization of URL schemes would allow that now, the reference (as per \u003chttps://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml#uri-schemes-1\u003e) \u003chttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics/19/\u003e \"HTTP Semantics\" section 4.2.4 \"Deprecation of userinfo in http(s) URIs\" states that such a part is (a) deprecated, (b) must not be generated by senders, and (c) should be treated as an error by receivers.  In light of that, I would argue against extending INetURLObject to support such a part in http and/or https URLs.  (For example, it could mean that we would accidentally start to generate such URLs in certain request scenarios, which we must not do.)",
