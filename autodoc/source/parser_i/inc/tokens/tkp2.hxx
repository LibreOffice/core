/** This is the interface for parser classes, which get a sequence of Token s from
    a text.

    Start() starts to parse the text from the given i_rSource.
    GetNextToken() returns a Token on the heap as long as there are
    still characters in the text left. The last time GetNextToken()
    returns NULL.

    The algorithms for parsing tokens from the text are an issue of
    the derived classes.
