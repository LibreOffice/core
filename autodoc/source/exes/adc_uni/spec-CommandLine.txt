        Historical Command Line Options
        -------------------------------

autodoc.exe
    [ -v <VerboseNr> ]
    -html <OutputDirectory>
    {
        [ -parse ]
	[ -name <RepositoryName> ]
        -lg <ProgrammingLanguage>
        {
            [ -p <ProjectName> <ProjectRootDirectory> ]
            {
                -t <SourceDirectory>*
                -d <SourceDirectory>*
                -f <SourceFile>*
            }+
        }+
    }

Legend:
    <Text>
    	command line parameter
    [ ]
    	optional
    { }
    	Block of connected options.
    The sequence of not connected options does not matter. So the -html or -v options can be used before or after all the parsing options.
    +
    	once or more times
    *
    	none or more times


Explanation of the Options
    -v <VerboseNr> 	Only for debugging. Bits 1, 2 and 4 in any combination give different output.
    -html <OutputDirectory>
    	Gives the directory, where a HTML version of the docu shall be generated.
    -parse 	Starts the block, where all the parse options are given. This can be omitted, because the parse options are identifiable without it, but it may make a commandline more readable.
    -name <RepositoryName> 	This name appears as title of the documentation (currently only in the in the C++ version).
    -lg <ProgrammingLanguage>


    Possible values are:

    c++
        This parses all files with the endings .hxx and .h .
    idl
        This parses all files with the ending .idl .

    -p with -t/-d/-f: 	If there are more than one project, the -p option is required for each one.

    The directory given wit the -p option is the root directory of the project.
    If there is no -p option, the working directory is seen as root.

    All paths given with -t/-d/-f are relative to that root directory. It is possible to use "." as argument for -t or -d.

    Each of -t/-d/-f can have several arguments:
    One could write "-f file1.hxx file2.hxx file_xyz.hxx"
    After each -p (or after -lg, if there is no -p option), there has to be at least one of the following three:
    -t 	Tree, which means: include subdirectories
    -d 	Directory, which means: no subdirectories
    -f 	File", which means: single file name with ending.
    This option also allows to parse some files with an ending different from those, the -lg option implies.
