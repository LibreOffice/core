My ideal would be to have an additional ctor that takes its param by rvalue reference, then the caller can decide. (Sure, I understand that you assume that the caller won\u0027t bother to correctly decide in most cases, and there is some truth in it.)\n\nUnless I misunderstand what you do here. :-)",
