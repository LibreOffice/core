      "message": "I put this in GenericCommands because it seems like if this one is used more often, then it ought to be as consistent as possible (specifically the accelerator key). Correct decision?\n\nInterestingly, this is only used in SW, and then as a main menu. The writerCommands also defines the label identically - perhaps it could/should be deleted from that one if defined here?",
