And while \u003chttps://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/os/part4-formula/OpenDocument-v1.3-os-part4-formula.html#__RefHeading__1017856_715980110\u003e \u0027Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) Version 1.3.

For example, the currently bundled external/icu\u0027s icu4c-70_1-src.tgz uses Unicode 14 (according to \u003chttps://icu.unicode.org/download/70#h.x1orhyniml8k\u003e) for its implementation of u_isdefined.  And for --with-system-icu, all that configure.ac apparently requires is that \u0027icu-i18n \u003e\u003d 4.6\u0027 (i.e., it will potentially allow the behavior of u_isdefined to vary over a wide range of Unicode versions).\"\n\nCan somebody knowledgeable about the ODF standard clarify what the behavior of CLEAN should be?  Should it follow some specific version of the Unicode standard (5.2 maybe), or shall its behavior vary depending on which Unicode version happens to be used by some ODF-conforming software?",
