      "message": "I think this would mostly happen to work (though I would rather use the all-encompassing rtl_UriCharClassUric), as the various URL schemes prevalently use UTF-8 by now, but it would break e.g. for internationalized domain names, which need a different sort of encoding than percent-encoding.\nI think I would stick here with the INetURLObject route, which is already used in other places in this file too, something like\n\n  INetURLObject(rWidget.m_aListEntries.front()).GetMainURL(INetURLObject::DecodeMechanism::WithCharset);",

      "message": "And looking at this piece of code, a related issue appears to be that the argument to\n\n  aLine.append( ... )\n\ncould contain characters that must not appear unescaped in a PDF string literal, like a lone \"(\" parenthesis.  This looks like it is broken ever since the code got introduced with \u003chttps://git.libreoffice.org/core/+/6822a05136317f4fdd155055fc10feefe7c44832%5E!/\u003e \"INTEGRATION: CWS pdf03 (1.92.20)\", and should probably use appendLiteralString instead.  Can you fix all of that in one go?",
