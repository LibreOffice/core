It probably is not even correct to have a radio-group with none selected by default - although it is possible and I can see how that could be nice to have on forms etc. So I wouldn\u0027t want to \"lose\" that edge case.",

Since that is really hard to know which one will be the first one, if ALL of them are tabstopped, then the first one in the list will be jumped to, selected, and untabstop the rest. So I would say that each one should be initialized as tabstopped until one of them is checked.",
