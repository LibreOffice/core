      "message": "With this change the break is only copied if the selection starts before the paragraph with break. That solves the problem from #39400.\n\nThe negative side is that I cannot copy a (e.g. landscape) page format from the first page anymore. If I want to copy such a page  I have to make sure to select from the end of the previous page. That is not possible if the previous page ends with a section, or a table.\n\np.s.: If this change will really be integrated then the variable bCopyCollFormat and all related code should also be removed.",

      "message": "I have tested and is solved the bug 97526. \nIt not copy the first page-break, and it is not only the first line from the first page. The Bug 39400 descript the first line of the first page, but in the current LO it is solve but i think the solution is a break of the odt.\n\nWhen you make a manual break, then it copy this to the next page. But it is not logical when i copy the first line of the page, i get a new page.\n\np.s: at the line 1032 it set to true, but i can remove in line 1015 it is always true, now",
