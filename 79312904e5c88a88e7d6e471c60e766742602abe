      "message": "With this change the break is only copied if the selection starts before the paragraph with break. That solves the problem from #39400.\n\nThe negative side is that I cannot copy a (e.g. landscape) page format from the first page anymore. If I want to copy such a page  I have to make sure to select from the end of the previous page. That is not possible if the previous page ends with a section, or a table.\n\np.s.: If this change will really be integrated then the variable bCopyCollFormat and all related code should also be removed.",
