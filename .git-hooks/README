Git hooks are executable scripts you can place in $GIT_DIR/hooks directory to trigger action at certain points.

To install manually, run:

  cd .git/hooks && ln -s ../../.git-hooks/* ./

There are two groups of these hooks: client side and server side.

The client-side hooks:
are for client operations such as committing and merging.

The server-side hooks:
are for Git server operations such as receiving pushed commits.
