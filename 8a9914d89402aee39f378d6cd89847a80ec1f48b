      "message": "It\u0027s used to cycle through the various relative/absolute address combinations. Usually a user writes something like A1:B2, then if s/he wants absolute addressing instead hits Shift-F4 and gets $A$1:$B$2 and each Shift-F4 another combination of absolute flags. So yes, order matters and minus operator is needed, unless you want to rewrite the series as a switch case state machine..",
