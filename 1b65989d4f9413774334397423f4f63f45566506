      "message": "But is this any improvement?  For one, it would probably want to use std::move, not std::copy.  But then, it would still default construct a Sequence with N elements before moving the actual elements into it.  I think a specialization for std::vector is useful in any case (and be it two specializations maybe, for lvalue vs. rvalue references to std::vector).",
