      "message": "Does it look to you? I hesitated between taking a plain int (to make it simple) or something like sal_Int32 (to force 32 bits number but is it what we want here?) instead of sal_IntPtr, I don\u0027t know how to choose. About the define, I think constexpr is the last right way but perhaps new features of C++ brought something else even better?\nI know this patch seems very straightforward to ask some advice but sometimes devil is in the details :-)",
