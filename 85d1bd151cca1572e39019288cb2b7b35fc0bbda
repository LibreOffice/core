      "message": "It looks like fdo#66145 is a UI bug unrelated to ooxml - I\u0027m not quite sure how best to test that.\n\nThe commit which introduced this test case (2d5978b22b402dea9dee5b468d2044ccc1208a15) looks problematic:\n\n- Michael Stahl reverted that part of it which was relevant to fdo#66145 in bf206549228685a68e1504db05119d8fa1d354b3\n\n- The change to the docx import filter I am wanting to revert in this present patch\n\n- The change to the docx export looks wrong too",
