      "message": "I guess that if you don\u0027t change the order here, what happens is:\n\n1. first, a temporary KahanSum is created as ta result of multiplication;\n2. A temporary KahanSum is created from pPolynom[i];\n3. The two temporaries are summed, performing two calls to add(double) (for each component of right-hand KahanSum elements)\n4. The result is assigned to nVal.\n\nI suppose that it\u0027s better to expand this:\n\n        nVal *\u003d x;\n        nVal +\u003d pPolynom[i];\n\nThis makes a single call to add() and does not copy anything.",
