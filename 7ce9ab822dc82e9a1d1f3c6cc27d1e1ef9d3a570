      "message": "OString internally stores a length as well as a char[], so this should rather be\n   std::vector\u003cstd::vector\u003cOString\u003e\u003e\nor\n  std::vector\u003cstd::vector\u003cstd::pair\u003cchar*,unsigned long\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nAlso, as I have noted in the getBytes() method, OString and data that contains zero values are not going to play well together - it can be done, but then you need to construct the OString by using the constructor that takes two parameters i.e. using an explicit length parameter.",

      "message": "The two sizes are different. In practice, the length of the OString shouldn\u0027t be used here, because tha data is not actually a string, and it may contain \u0027\\0\u0027.\n\nI don\u0027t want to use char* either, because I need memory management here. I could use unique_ptr as well, but I think it wouldn\u0027t be that nice. With OString, I can easily transform the data to the types I need here.\n\nI could also handle it as a sequence\u003csal_Int8\u003e. Than it would be more clearer that it is raw data, but than I would lose the feature rich OString methods.\n\nI could explain it with a comment above the declaration.",
