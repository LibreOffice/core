      "message": "Note how the function is named here in the dialog. It is not \"SfxCommonTemplateDialog_Impl::SetBCanedit\", it is \"SfxCommonTemplateDialog_Impl::EnableEdit\". We should avoid use of the names like \"SetBCanedit\" or \"nActFamilySetter\", because these names do not tell user what they actually do from functional point of view - instead they just expose some implementation details to user. A \"EnableEdit\" is a telling name, describing user that when one calls it, then after the call, the object is editable (or not, depending on the parameter) - and that\u0027s a *functional* description; user is *not* interested if the change is performed by setting some flag, or by executing a hundred of different functions.\n\nSo *even if* your public function only sets some internal variable, you need to name if *after the function that is performed by setting it*. And the number of such setters must be minimal - every time you need a public setter, you should think that something needs simplification here.",
