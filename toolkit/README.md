# Abstract Windowing Toolkit

"Abstract" windowing thing. UNO implementations of windowing stuff so that it
can be used from Basic or Java. But also stuff that has no connection to Basic
or Java.

## Notes

The "awt" here has no relation to the Java AWT, as far as I know. It
might be inspired by it API-wise, perhaps. (If you know differently, feel free
to improve this `README.md` file.)

Also note that `toolkit/` is itself not really a toolkit, it is at root a
reasonably simple wrapper of `vcl/`. If you came here looking for a
toolkit, please look at `vcl/` instead.
