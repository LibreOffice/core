      "message": "Well, this provides a little playground to explore that. The \"screen\" positions are the glyph positions that would look the best when rendered on screen and the \"printing\" positions are where the glyphs will really be when printed to paper. At some lower font sizes, e.g. 50% zoom, the optimal screen positions create noticeably wider text and beginning words at their print positions and keeping their relative screen positions results in words eating the whitespace between words.",
