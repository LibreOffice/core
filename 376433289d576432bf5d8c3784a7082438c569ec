      "message": "This is wrong. The following code assumes that there is a multi-mark and if not then obtaining aMarkRange below with GetMultiMarkArea() always results in a range (0,0,t,0,0,t), by luck an object anchored to A1 is not deleted because rMark.IsAllMarked(aRange) always returns false if there is no multi-mark.\n\nTo be correct, if there is no multi-mark and bAnchored was passed then rMark should be converted to a multi-mark (i.e. copy to temporary and call aTempMark.MarkToMulti() and afterwards operate only on aTempMark).\n\nBtw, a space would had been nice for readability,\n\n \u0026\u0026 !bAnchored",
