This is possibly ok if the old way of doing things was basically rubbish anyway.\n\nShould we do a version bump in \"SvmWriter::TextArrayHandler\" from 2 to 3 and stream out the new kasdida information there, and read it in at SvmReader::TextArrayHandler ?",

      "message": "I think this particular line in SvmConverter.cxx is for a super old type of metafile so it probably doesn\u0027t matter to much.\n\nThe SvmReader.cxx/SvmWriter.cxx stuff for contemporary svm\u0027s probably does matter. We definitely use them to temporarily record and play back things. I think for stuff like print preview in the print dialog, and other places where we record to a metafile and scale it and/or transport metafiles around to replay them.\n\nAdding that can be done in some follow up commit I guess, so I guess lets not make the perfect the enemy of the good and you should go ahead and merge this IMO",
