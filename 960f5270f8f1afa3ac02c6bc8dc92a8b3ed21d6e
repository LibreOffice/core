That kind of message also allows others to see what you intended to do, and clearly see if some phenomena they see were intended or not - maybe there was an unanticipated regression, and the message would help to see that. (Note that you are welcome to elaborate in additional message lines, as much as you need to explain whatever needs explanation, beyond the ~70 characters in the first line.)",
