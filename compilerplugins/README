Compiler plugins.

== Overview ==

This directory contains code for compiler plugins. These are used to perform
additional actions during compilation (such as additional warnings) and
also to perform mass code refactoring.

Currently only the Clang compiler is supported (http://clang.llvm.org).

== Usage ==

Compiler plugins are enabled automatically by --enable-dbgutil if Clang headers
are found or explicitly using --enable-compiler-plugins.


== Functionality ==

=== Compile plugin ===

The compile plugin is used during normal compilation to perform additional checks.
All warnings and errors are marked '[loplugin]' in the message.


== Code documentation / howtos ==
