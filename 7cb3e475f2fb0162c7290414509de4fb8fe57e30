      "message": "I test UITests on Windows from time to time. And in this case, the problem seems to be not UITest-specific (UITests run in full GUI on Windows by default, with normal win plugin).\n\nI moved the asserts past caching code in https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/134192 - exactly to make the intermitted assert failure less frequent. If you decide to \u0027make UITest_chart\u0027 on Windows, you might want to revert that my change.\n\nMy hope was that you would see why the assertion is failing, maybe there\u0027s something waiting for a fix :-)",
