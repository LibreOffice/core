      "message": "This is unneeded complexity.\n\nFor the number of values, you don\u0027t need them: your wanted value is the *default* one (with empty name), not the one named \"LibreOffice N\".\n\nFor the length, you have several choices.\n* You could reasonably assume a buffer of MAX_PATH. But of course, with long paths became reality with Win10, it could sometime become a problem. Still, you use the MAX_PATH when you get the module name, so...\n* You could get this module name first, and then create a buffer of the size returned by that. That\u0027s also an overkill, since you need a heap allocation.\n* My preferred would be use our LONG_MAX_PATH. Having two 64K byte buffers (for reg value and for module name) is fine; in a function that is known to not run when we are near stack overflow (and is known to not call stack-hungry functions itself) it is the easiest and best option.",
