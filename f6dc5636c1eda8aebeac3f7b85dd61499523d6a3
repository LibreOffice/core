      "message": "Well, it\u0027s old stuff. I don\u0027t remember exactly the things. However, the code also searches for the next \"|\" character in rest2 (\"nURIlen \u003d rest2.indexOf(\"|\");\"), so there it seems useful that it is decoded too and later the prefix of rest2 copied to the arg which does not contain any \"|\" character, right? So the arg won\u0027t contain any decoded character. So it seems OK to me.\nIn the last \"else\" case we do not touch the original rest1 variable so rest2 won\u0027t be decoded at all, as I see.",
