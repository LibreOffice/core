      "message": "When opening the attachment of the bugtracker it works, but I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the right way to fix this.\n\nAt least, it seems SwFramePage::UpdateExample in sw/source/ui/frmdlg/frmpage.cxx has the right values:\n\"3\" when selecting \"Left of frame text area\" which corresponds to PAGE_LEFT in offapi/com/sun/star/text/RelOrientation.idl\n\"4\" when selecting \"Right of frame text area\" which corresponds to PAGE_RIGHT in the same idl file.\n(BTW, I wonder why it wasn\u0027t 5 and 6 for FRAME_LEFT and FRAME_RIGHT but that\u0027s another story).\nso if parameters provided to m_aExampleWN which is SwFrameExample, I thought the pb may be in SwFrameExample implementation.\n\nHope I\u0027m right and won\u0027t trigger some regression because of a misinterpretation.",
