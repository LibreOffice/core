Do you say that MS Office can\u0027t open such encoded VBA? Then it would be a showstopper, right?\n\nAFAIK, VBA UI doesn\u0027t allow you to use non-ASCII characters other than from current Windows codepage (which means, that at least the UI is using 8-bit codepage, not Unicode). How would VBA behave when reading the code, I don\u0027t know (I agree it would be best if it allowed UTF-8); but in case it fails, we could at least avoid hardcoding a single codepage, and try to re-use the codepage that was used when opening, or use LO locale for the codepage, or try to be smart and analyze the code itself (worst option - most error-prone without any predictability IMO).",
