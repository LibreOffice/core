Instead, passing aFuncMark to the calls to DeleteObjectsInArea() looks like it would be better.\n\nHowever, even that might be not correct because only spans on the currently visible sheet nTab\u003dGetViewData().GetTabNo() are deleted here, so what we actually need is to create a ScMarkData with that one sheet set.",
