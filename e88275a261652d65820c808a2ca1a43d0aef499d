      "message": "It tries to make sure that no new clients obtain the address of pRefreshTimerControl after the guard has been established. However, it still looks wrong: GetRefreshTimerControlAddress looks used left and right, storing references to the object in multiple places; if the already stored ones outlive the object itself, they will be dangling.\n\nIt feels that it might be needed to use shared pointer + weak pointers instead of unique_ptr maybe?",

      "message": "Using shared_ptr or rtl::Reference sounds like a much better idea. Espeically since that mutex is now recursive, so releasing the lock is no guarantee that something higher up the stack does not also have a lock on it.",
