      "message": "Unfortunately, this does not protect against leaks when the ctor throws. That\u0027s because the unique_ptr wouldn\u0027t be constructed yet, nor would a reference to the allocated memory be reachable by any code (other than OConnection\u0027s ctor, which threw).\n\nThe proper solution is to call std::make_unique which forwards the args to the ctor and ensures thread-safe construction of a unique_ptr that does\u0027t leak.\n\nHowever, make_unique is missing from C++11 and it was only added in C++14.\n\nA cheap solution is to use shared_ptr and make_shared, which is short of writing make_unique (which is a bad idea).",
