      "message": "I\u0027m not entirely sure I follow why. My understanding of a const member function is that it does not alter the state of an object. I had to recheck my C++ reference book to make sure I was doing this correctly - and in fact, The C++ Programming Language 4th Edition, Stroustrup actually uses this as an example in chapter 16 with his Date::year() example.\n\nWhat in particular is wrong with this const?",

      "message": "Returning a non const member variable from a const functions breaks const correctness. See for example http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq/return-const-ref-from-const-memfn.html\nWhile it talks about references the same is true for pointers. More or less a const function signals that it won\u0027t change the object in any way but returning a non const member variable is breaking this promise.\n\nThe correct way to do this is to have a const overload that returns a const pointer.",
