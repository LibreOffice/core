      "message": "Looks nice - but in general code like this that needs to cope with a wide variety of performance in hardware terms - should have an aspirational timer - like every 40ms is fine - but it should be aware that these could happen every 500ms quite easily on slow / loaded hardware \u003d)\n\nAs such - we should track the time since the start of the fade - and calculate the opacity and whether we continue to do the work based on the real-world time-offset of when we get to do the work - and not calculate via \u0027timeout * some-count\u0027 - otherwise it can take far, far longer on a slow machine.\n\nDoes that make sense ? \u003d)\n\nThanks !",
