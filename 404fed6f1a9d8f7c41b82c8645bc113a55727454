Something like OApplicationIconControl::DoKeyShortCut does, loop over the form controls here and use vcl::I18nHelper::MatchMnemonic to see which one should be activated, just a thought in passing.",

      "message": "Thanks, this looks like a better approach (and it allows this method to actually return true when a widget was found).\nI changed this a bit, so that the widget only gets the focus, and is not actually triggered, with the mnemonic.\nI guess security wise this might be the better option.",
