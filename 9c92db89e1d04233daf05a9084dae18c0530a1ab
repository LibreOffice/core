      "message": "These two links are declared as public. I want to make them private. Earlier, they were private and a callback was used in Dialog. But when two controls are introduced, Dialog needs to know whether it is calling m_aStyleList\u0027s Family Select or m_aCharStyleList\u0027s Family Select. Hence, I had to make it public so that I can use it as m_aStyleList.FamilySelect(nullptr) or m_aCharStyleList.FamilySelect(nullptr). Is there an other alternative to it?",
