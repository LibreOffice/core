      "message": "But what do they actually document or protect?  As argued, they have no impact on the types\u0027 alignments and sizes, and they smell just like long-since irrelevant cargo cult that /may/ have had some relevance decades ago (esp. given the odd discrepancy in actual values 4 vs. 8).  To me, this all feels like e.g. some obsolete __far pointer annotations that we would have gotten rid of by now, too.",

Well, we don\u0027t have such for any other types (even if they are part of the stable URE interface), either, and it would look odd to me (esp. in the future when the #pragma pack lines have long since been removed) to have them just for these two types.",
