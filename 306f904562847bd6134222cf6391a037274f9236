      "message": "I don\u0027t like the filter name hard coded here. I think it would be better instead of the bool bOwn \u003d false declare a\n\n const OUString* pOwnFilter \u003d nullptr\n\nand if set let it act as a switch for SfxFilterFlags::OWN and m_pFileDlg-\u003eSetCurrentFilter() and pass it there.\n\nSo SwView_Impl::StartDocumentInserter() then would do something like\n\n OUString aFilter(\"ODF Text Document\");\n m_pDocInserter-\u003eStartExecuteModal( rEndDialogHdl, \u0026aFilter );\n\nThat way not only would the semantics be kept in Writer where they belong but also if needed other places could use it as well.\n\nNitpick: aFlags should be named eFlags because it is an enum.",
