The effective problem is in the import that isn\u0027t able anymore to correctly read what earlier versions stored, i.e. reading the bug\u0027s https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id\u003d117935 that was created using 4.4.6 must not fail, which this change doesn\u0027t address. Actually this change should not be needed.",
