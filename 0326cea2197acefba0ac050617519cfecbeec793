      "message": "If this helps performance, then it would be nice to have some before/after numbers for some workload, but otherwise no objections.\n\nFWIW the OOXML filter solves this problem by having a dedicated subclass for all the various \"value\" types (integer, string, etc): https://docs.libreoffice.org/writerfilter/html/classwriterfilter_1_1ooxml_1_1OOXMLValue.html\n\nIt might be useful to consider if this \"lazy allocation\" (done in this patch) or the OOXML way is better.\n\nI initially created a single Value class in the RTF case just because it was simpler to implement, but I did not consider the performance impacts.",
