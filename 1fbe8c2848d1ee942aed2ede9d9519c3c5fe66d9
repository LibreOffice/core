      "message": "Iterating the entire draw page for each and every cell position looks like a possible bottle neck to me. It probably would be better to gather all affected cell positions in one go and return a vector of vectors. Something to keep an eye on and follow-up with.\n\nProbably a parametrized call is needed to cater also for the if(!pDrawLayer-\u003eGetObjectsAnchoredToCell(aCell).empty()) call from ScColumn::IsDrawObjectsEmptyBlock()that does not need all objects but only presence of one in the range.",
