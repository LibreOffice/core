In case when following Property statements are just ignored, this will still work, making anObject a variant variable (because Option Explicit is not used); I would imagine a true test would be having *two* properties with different names, one to set the _obj variable, *another* to get it. Thus it would be unambiguous if the Option statement had executed, or not.",
