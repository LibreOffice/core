      "message": "Thanks Kevin,\n\nI am unsure about what regressions may be caused by showing the cursor here if it is determined that it can be shown. I have tested with x11, gtk3, and qt5 backends and the cursor shows like expected for all. Unit tests ran during build passed so Jenkins is happy.\n\nIt would be nice to have review by someone with knowledge of the SwView::SelectShell function.\n\nSince it does seem to fix the bug, perhaps just put it in and revert if found to cause regression.\n\nWhat do you think?",
