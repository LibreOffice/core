      "message": "Yes - but still, the real-life versions sometimes include the microversion etc: see what I mention in commit message about Liberation family. The two uses of the version field here are: 1. Know when to upgrade the font; and 2. not ignore font installation when OS-detected version is greater than detected by us. Both are better served when we consider the possible extra information, however non-standard it were.\n\nE.g., when Windows thinks that an installed Liberation font has version 2.0.1, and we offer standard-complying 2.0, MSI would not install our font, while removing the existing (as happened with Noto fonts in the tdf#116581). And if a font author would release a minor X.Y.Z+1, it still deserves to be upgraded.",
