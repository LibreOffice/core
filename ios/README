iOS app and LibreOfficeKit.

-- LibreOfficeLight
a swift based UI, very much work in progress

-- support
the arm64 and simulator are the only supported processors,
old 32 bit iPhones are not supported.

The swift app are done for 3 structures
  simulator + full debug libraries
  arm64 + full debug libraries
  arm64 + optimized libraries

-- SETUP
Due to the 3 modes, at least 3 workdirs are needed together with a
separated UI workdir.

Because the main work is done on the UI, where it is convenient to
switch fast between arm64 and simulator, it is advantageous to compile
the 3 configurations of LO first, and then link against those.

Due to the multiple workdirs a separate work directories are needed as follows:
(names/locations can be changes, they are "linked" together by running autogen.sh)
   ./core - libreoffice git clone (name can be changed)
   ./ios-arm64 - workdir for production
   ./ios-arm64-debug - workdir for debug on device
   ./ios-simulator - workdir for simulator-debug

-- Steps to generate
1) copy ./core/distro-configs/LibreOfficeiOS.conf to autogen.input in
   ./ios-arm64, ./ios-arm64-debug, ./ios-simulator
   Correct as defined in the conf file,
   add your local setup (e.g. location of tarballs)
2) run ../core/autogen.sh in ios-arm64, ios-arm64-debug and ios-simulator
3) run make in ios-arm64, ios-arm64-debug and ios-simulator
   this will generate core/loApp.xcconfig which prepares LO to be compiled
   and build LOkit is 3 configurations and store the preparedLibreOfficeKit
   in ./core/ios/generated as:
           release/libKit.a
           release/libKit.dylib
           debug/libKit.a
           debug/libKit.dylib
           simulator/libKit.a
           simulator/libKit.dylib
5) open xcode with LibreOfficeLight select scheme and build/test/run.
6) enjoy
