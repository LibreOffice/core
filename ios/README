iOS experimental app and LibreOfficeKit.

-- experiments/LibreOfficeKit
prelink all LO libraries into one to facilitate easier linking

-- experiments/LibreOfficeLight
a swift based UI, very much work in progress

-- support
the arm64 and simulator are the only supported processors,
old 32 bit iPhones are not supported.

The swift app are done for 3 structures
  simulator + full debug libraries
  arm64 + full debug libraries
  arm64 + optimized libraries

-- SETUP
Due to the 3 modes, at least 3 workdirs are needed together with a
separated UI workdir.

Because the main work is done on the UI, where it is convenient to
switch fast between arm64 and simulator, it is advantageous to compile
the 3 configurations of LO first, and then link against those.

Due to the multiple workdirs a distinct directory setup is needed
   ./core - libreoffice git clone (name can be changed)
   ./ios-arm64 - workdir for production, autogen.input:
                        standard +
                        #--enable-debug
                        #--enable-ios-simulator
                        --host=arm64-apple-darwin
   ./ios-arm64-debug - workdir for debug on device, autogen.input:
                        standard +
                        --enable-debug
                        #--enable-ios-simulator
                        --host=arm64-apple-darwin
   ./ios-simulator - workdir for simulator-debug, autogen.input:
                        standard +
                        --enable-debug
                        --enable-ios-simulator
                        --host=arm64-apple-darwin
   ./ios-app - workdir for UI, NO autogen.input

-- Steps to generate
1) copy ./core/distro-configs/LibreOfficeiOS.conf to autogen.input in
   ./ios-arm64, ./ios-arm64-debug, ./ios-simulator
   Correct as per above, add your local setup (e.g. location of tarballs)
2) run ../core/autogen.sh in ios-arm64, ios-arm64-debug and ios-simulator
   this will generate ./*/ios/lo.xcconfig and prepare LO to be compiled
3) run make in ios-arm64, ios-arm64-debug and ios-simulator
   this will build LO is 3 configurations and store the LibreOfficeKit
   libraries in ./ios-app/libraries as:
           ./ios-app/Library/LibreOfficeKit-arm64.a
           ./ios-app/Library/LibreOfficeKit-arm64-debug.a
           ./ios-app/Library/LibreOfficeKit-simulator.a
4) open xcode with LibreOfficeLight and enjoy
