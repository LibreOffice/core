      "message": "Hi. This is Patch 1 of the implementation of OpenLockedQueryBox. I\u0027ve implemented the box as a UI dialog; for now, I\u0027ve not put any icon in the dialog image (I wanted it to be a question mark icon, just like in the original dialog). But it seems like LO doesn\u0027t have support for that icon yet. \n\nSo, I can remove the icon all together if it isn\u0027t needed, or I can add another question mark icon to the dialog; but I will need some assistance on how to do that.\n\nFor a preview of the dialog, I\u0027ve uploaded an image on Bugzilla: https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d141026. Kindly refer to the image for a preview of the dialog.\n\nAny suggestions will be great.",
