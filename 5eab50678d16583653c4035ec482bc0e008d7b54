      "message": "I\u0027ll look at DOC again - but it seemed to be working OK already. RTF subscripts were a disaster right from the start, so I have been ignoring that (other than to try to not make it worse...)\n\nIf I remember correctly, DOC imports fine - probably because the binary format always provides a fontsize value? DOCX doesn\u0027t necessarily provide that which complicates things.\n\nSo I believe that at this point only DOCX forces default ESC/PROP on charstyle import, so only the DOCX export needs to do the same.",
