As written, the check would be OK for ftp, http, mailto, and vnd.sun.star.webdav.  What about other schemes like https or those other http/webdav aliases (dav, davs, vnd.sun.star.webdavs, webdav, webdavs), or smb, or...?  (And any idea what that \"this is our old without the Mail-Export\" comment is meant to mean?)",
