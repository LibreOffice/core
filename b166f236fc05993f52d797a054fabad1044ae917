      "message": "So this now would pass on all systems. We now don\u0027t get the thread encoding (that would be UTF-8 on most Linuxes), but instead we take the LibreOffice language (which is configured to be en-US for unit tests explicitly IIRC), and picks the encoding corresponding to MS codepage associated with that language - for en-US, it would be Win-1252, giving us 1-byte string. I suppose that we may even assert on the content of the byte string now. And add a comment here explaining these details.\n\nThis looks like a reasonable change for me. Using that \"system encoding\" (which on Windows means \"default encoding for non-Unicode applications\") in a different way is just meaningless here.",
