What used to be the desktop in StarOffice 5 - now the binary.


Stable Interface
================

Some of the artifacts built here are part of a LibreOffice installation set's
stable interface, which (programmatic) clients can depend on.  Among them are:

soffice
=======

In the "program" directory ("program/" on Linux and Windows, "Contents/MacOS/"
on Mac OS X).

unoinfo
=======

In the "program" directory ("program/" on Linux and Windows, "Contents/MacOS/"
on Mac OS X).

When called with a sole argument of "c++", it prints to stdout an absolute
pathname denoting the directory where the public URE libraries are found.

When called with a sole argument of "java", it prints to stdout a marker
character (either an ASCII '0' or '1') followed by a sequence of zero or more
absolute pathnames denoting jars or directories that need to be included in a
class loader's search locations.

If the marker character is '0' (on Linux and Mac OS X), the pathnames are
encoded as bytes, and any two pathnames in the sequence are separated from each
other by NUL bytes.

If the marker character is '1' (on Windows), the pathnames are encoded as
UTF-16-LE two-byte code units, and any two pathnames in the sequence are
separated from each other by two-byte NUL code units.
