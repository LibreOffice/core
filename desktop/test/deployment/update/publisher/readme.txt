pub8.oxt
================================================================================
Need not be committed in extensions/www/testarea/desktop.

pub8.oxt is intended for tests with extensions.services.openoffice.org.

the update information from the repository as feed:

http://updateext.services.openoffice.org/ProductUpdateService/check.Update

pub8.oxt provides <publisher> and <release-notes>. These information should be transferred
in the update feed and not those entered in the repository.

Repository:

-Create the new extension in the repository. 
-Provide a company name and a URL to the company website. This setting should be ignored
 when generating the update feed. Instead the publisher name from the extension is used.

 "Publisher URL": any arbitrary URL but not:
 http://extensions.openoffice.org/testarea/desktop/publisher/publisher_en-US.html
  
-Create a new release for the extension. Upload the version 2.0 (update/pub8.oxt).

 the release notes link.
