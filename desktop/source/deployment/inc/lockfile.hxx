/* Information:
 * This class implements a mechanism to lock a users installation directory,
 * which is necessesary because instances of staroffice could be running on
 * different hosts while using the same directory thus causing data
 * inconsistency.
 * When an existing lock is detected, the user will be asked whether he wants
 * to continue anyway, thus removing the lock and replacing it with a new one
 *
 * ideas:
 * - store information about user and host and time in the lockfile and display
 * these when asking whether to remove the lockfile.
 * - periodically check the lockfile and warn the user when it gets replaced
 *
