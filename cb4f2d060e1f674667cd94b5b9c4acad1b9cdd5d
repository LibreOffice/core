Having even a few different hashes for cases where there are ASCII among first 6 would already improve performance for such strings.",

But I very much assume that the comment and behavior date back to pre-Unicode times, where the given string was an 8-bit string in whatever code page, and the developer just didn\u0027t want to bother at all with whatever implications that had.  Presumably, that\u0027s no longer relevant (esp. if those hash values are not made persistent in some file format, but which I didn\u0027t check).",
