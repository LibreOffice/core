(pycodestyle E501, long lines) - and in mobile-config.py there\u0027s complaints about not using same indent as next logical line (E125) (pylint also complains about the too-long-lines and also has more stylistic complaints, e.g. variables \"f\" and \"r\" not conforming to snake_case style or that some constants don\u0027t follow UPPER_CASE naming style..",
