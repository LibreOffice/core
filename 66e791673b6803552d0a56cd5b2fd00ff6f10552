Are you trying to save a few bytes here? One check per line.\n\nYou could create a function in the file, like\n\n    Sub assert(expression As Boolean, errmessage As String)\n        If Not expression Then\n            print errmessage\n            raise ...\n        End If\n    End Sub\n\nand allow it to do the magic of breaking out on error:\n\n    assert(TypeName(int16) \u003d \"Integer\", \"TypeName(int16) is not \"\"Integer\"\"\")",
