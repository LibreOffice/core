(The return type of base-class SvxShowCharSet::FirstInView in svx/source/dialog/charmap.cxx is int, so that might be a more obvious choice?  Especially as the return type of this virtual LastInView function is also int?  If sal_uInt32 was chosen because there are tricks involved here that guarantee to avoid overflow, please document that.)",
