      "message": "About the comment - agree, I\u0027ll move it to the hxx file.\n\nAbout the braces. For me it\u0027s some kind of a small rule of thumb. I just pick\nan approach of using braces everywhere. It simplifies things because now you\ndon\u0027t need to think is it OK for other developers to see one line \"if\" or\n\"if/else\" without the braces. During the review I usually force developers to\nuse braces because sometimes as you know avoiding braces may lead to very\ninteresting construction :) aka:\n\n ```\n if (a \u003d\u003d 10)\n    if (b \u003c 20)\n        // do\n    else\n        // done\nelse\n{\n   // etc\n}\n```\n\nBTW, did you mean to avoid braces only in \"SearchStockPen\" or in the whole\npatch?",

      "message": "Well - as you like; it\u0027s just a matter of taste, and I won\u0027t insist on one style or the other (as I didn\u0027t previously) - I just expressed my aesthetic feelings.\n\nPersonally I prefer to avoid braces for 1-liners where no ambiguity possible (e.g., in your example, I\u0027d enclose the whole inner if..else into braces, but their own //do and //done would be without braces if 1-line). I usually use braces with 1-liners when also a comment is needed... well - that\u0027s a matter of taste, as I mentioned.\n\nA note: when you will review others here, please refrain from *forcing* them to use braces (as you told you do), because personal opinions are OK here, but not as something enforced. At least unless you have a good objective reason to require that.",
