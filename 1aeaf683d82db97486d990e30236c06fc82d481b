      "message": "About the comment - agree, I\u0027ll move it to the hxx file.\n\nAbout the braces. For me it\u0027s some kind of a small rule of thumb. I just pick\nan approach of using braces everywhere. It simplifies things because now you\ndon\u0027t need to think is it OK for other developers to see one line \"if\" or\n\"if/else\" without the braces. During the review I usually force developers to\nuse braces because sometimes as you know avoiding braces may lead to very\ninteresting construction :) aka:\n\n ```\n if (a \u003d\u003d 10)\n    if (b \u003c 20)\n        // do\n    else\n        // done\nelse\n{\n   // etc\n}\n```\n\nBTW, did you mean to avoid braces only in \"SearchStockPen\" or in the whole\npatch?",
