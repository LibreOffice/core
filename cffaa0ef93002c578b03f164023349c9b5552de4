(Jenkins may help here).\nDon\u0027t hesitate to tell if I\u0027m wrong and explain the use of this file.\n\nIf Jenkins is ok and no feedback, I\u0027ll push this in 24/48h.\n\nAs usual, it can be reverted quickly if someone finds a pb with it.\n\nI don\u0027t plan to cherry-pick this on 7.3 branch since it fixes nothing (and may bring some regression).\n\nMy goal is to remove \"sdbc:mysqlc:\" and \"DST_MYSQL_NATIVE_DIRECT\" to simplify and keep only \"sdbc:mysql:mysqlc:\" and \"DST_MYSQL_NATIVE\"\n\nAgain, perhaps I miss something.",
