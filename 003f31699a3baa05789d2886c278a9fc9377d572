      "message": "As I was writing up the promised documentation, I couldn\u0027t find any way to explain why a style could validly hold a level 10 when the UI use of that style will really cause user confusion.\n\nChapterNumberingTortureTest is a good example file if you want to play with this. Heading 3 specifies ilvl\u003d9.\n\nBut I don\u0027t really understand SW\u0027s behaviour. It seems like it\n-takes the existing listlevel\n-applies the numbering with that level\n-then applies the new level.\n\nBut a little experimentation shows I\u0027m missing some things, and this isn\u0027t accurate or else it has other missing pieces. Although it is really outside of my experience, I think I\u0027ll try to investigate this tomorrow.\n\nAnnoyingly the style inspector doesn\u0027t match up with the visual results when things to weird.",
