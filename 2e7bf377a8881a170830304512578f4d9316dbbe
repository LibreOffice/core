      "message": "I like the move towards using SwTwips at multiple places. If you ask my input, I would:\n\n1) Split this large patch to a minimal fix + a follow-up mass conversion. This way you can backport the minimal fix to 7.2. At least I\u0027m not smart enough to review the current mass-conversion on a release branch. :-)\n\n2) Undo the changes to ruby.fodt and redo them with a text editor. It\u0027s not clear to me what you changed there \u0026 why in its current form. If possible, it would be good to do that in a separate commit (with a commit message explaining the \"why\"): ideally you should never touch existing test code or data and source code in the same commit.\n\n3) Once you have a minimal fix, I\u0027m happy to try to cover it with a test.\n\nAnyhow, nice work! Looking forward to get this in.",
