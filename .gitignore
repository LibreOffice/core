# LibreOffice project .gitignore rules.
#
# Do not add you pet ignore rule here, use
# .git/info/exclude for per repo personal ignore or
# in the file specified by core.excludesfiles in your
# ~/.gitconfig
#
# As a rule of thumb:
# File that are generated by configure or the build
# but that are not deleted by make clean
# can be listed here... These must be deleted by maek distclean
#
# Files that are generated by the build but deleted by make clean
# should all be under workdir or solver
# if that is not the case, don't hide it here, but try to fix it
#
# The intent is that after a make distclean, .gitignore
# should not catch anything but possibly /src
#

# where stuff are built
/instdir
/workdir
/solver

# these two are dubbious. when the installed is reworked
# it would be best to find them a new home
/instsetoo_native/util/LibreOffice
/instsetoo_native/util/LibreOffice_SDK

# where the external downloads maybe located
/src


# autoconf generated stuff
