      "message": "Thanks for the detailed commit message, this looks like a nice improvement to me.\n\nOne nitpick: DrawingML::WriteCustomGeometry() is very long, almost 500 lines of code. If you are interested, I think it would be nice to split it up to smaller functions to make it more readable. Perhaps extract a WriterCustomGeometrySegment() out of it, containing the rather large \"switch (rSegment.Command)\" block? That seems to be about half of the function.",
