      "message": "related to my looking into preferring LastRU function names for tdf#92010.\n\nThe autolookup stuff is SUPPOSED to be prioritized as Standard, Names(ranges), DbNames, Headers(rows/column names). But they are all categorized as Standard because of this wrong use of the CTOR that I am fixing. So someone could complain about workflow being changed if they prefer the buggy behaviour.\n\nThis will also affect validation - where values were never considered values, but just as standard strings. Not sure what impact this has, since I don\u0027t know much about validation.",
