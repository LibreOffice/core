Also the ScDrawView isn\u0027t guaranteed to exist, so check that as well.\n\nActually that static ScDocShell::GetViewData() obtains the \"best current view\" whatever that may be.. if the document is in the background of another one it\u0027s not what one expected. So all this looks a tad fragile though most times it will work, but sometimes it may not.",
