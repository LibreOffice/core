      "message": "Test 1 - round-trip test document.\n   -result: as expected, extra columns displayed beyond AMJ - same as the initial bug report, but this time beyond the 1024 limit instead of the 64 limit: not a problem. No slower than expected. when additional columns created.\n\nTest 2 - hide jumbo rows\n   -result: crash attempting to hide rows (step 4 above), so cannot test this patch\u0027s effect. But apart from export bugs, this patch should not cause a reload to be any slower than the original document - because that one will have already created the maximum number of rows and columns anyway. I.E. it will be a really bad idea for a user to hide all columns and rows in a jumbo sheet.",
