      "message": "This is wrong. If a sheetname was prefixed that is not the current sheet and it is stripped, the rangename then may be found as a current sheet local name or a global name, but wasn\u0027t meant as neither. Instead, the rangename (stripped off the sheetname) must be looked up from a sheet named sheetname and not be found as global name at all. Apart from that hard-wiring Parse_XL_Header() ignores the AddressConvention aConv passed..\n\nHowever, the code below does not handle sheet-local names at all and prefers global names over local names as it obtains current sheet local names only if a global names was not found (and then does nothing), which is also wrong.",
