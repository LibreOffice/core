      "message": "My understanding is that this \"DefaultWindow\" is never visible and is a reference window/device. So that suggests it doesn\u0027t really need an icon that will never be shown.\n\nWe already have a guard to not create an icon for the SalFrameStyleFlags::INTRO case which is for the splashscreen window and I bet we do that for a similar reason to this.\n\nSo perhaps an alternative solution is to also not create an icon for a new SalFrameStyleFlags::NOICON case which I guess could be done similar to how INTRO in vcl/source/window/window.cxx is done, except with nStyle \u0026 WB_DEFAULTWIN set a new NOICON state. (Which would then need to be added to vcl/inc/salframe.hxx SalFrameStyleFlags)",
