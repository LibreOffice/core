      "message": "You may know that cui/source/dialogs/AdditionsDialog.cxx:488 uses a temporary URL pattern like https://extensions.libreoffice.org/api/v0/allextensions.json which is introduced by cloph to replace a faulty personal URL remaining from a GSoC project. So, if this URL is needed to be changed in this patch, a new URL pattern will be needed. IMO, this change needs additional work to setup script and API, and it can be postponed.",
