      "message": "Ordering headings in the Navigator tree by document layout position, as this patch does, causes chapter promote/demote breakage when the document has outline nodes in the Writer document model special section for frames, headers, and footers. I hadn\u0027t thought about this until after merging the patch, Ahhh! WIP on a solution. Should we revert until promote/demote works for this case? ",

I think it\u0027s always better to fix the side-effect problems. There is still time before the release of 7.3",
