You have introduced the m_sDirectory to hold dynamically changing selected directory updated in VistaFilePickerEventHandler::OnFolderChange handler using GetDirectory, which calls just that GetFolder. I must miss something: why is it possible to use GetFolder on each OnFolderChange to store current path into a member, but not possible to use it once when it\u0027s asked in impl_sta_GetDirectory (where it\u0027s used as the fallback)?\n\nSorry for being slow.",
