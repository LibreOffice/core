      "message": "Converting the number -693595 (which is intended to be 0001-01-01) to string representation in SvNumberformat::ImpGetDateOutput calls GregorianCalendar::handleComputeFields (in UnpackedTarball/icu/source/i18n/gregocal.cpp). And there I can see that the value of \u0027julianDay\u0027 - which is the representation of the date passed from Calc (-693595) in the GregorianCalendar, counting from somewhere ~-4713-01-01, is 1721424, while \u0027kJan1_1JulianDay\u0027 (defined in UnpackedTarball/icu/source/i18n/gregoimp.h as \"January 1, year 1 (Gregorian)\") is 1721426. We obviously have something very wrong here.",
