I\u0027d prefer if it was changed to call the function - then the function could be extended to do some validation of the provided platform string... Or get rid of the function since it doesn\u0027t really do anything useful at this point.\n\nthe check could also be placed in the test for system switch in line 45. If argv[4] is \"--system\"... else if argv[4] is \"--platform\" â†’ check for presence of argv[5]\n\nAnd probably the variable should also be renamed to just platform",

      "message": "Crashreporting is only available for windows and linux, so those are the two systems in question - but even if it wasn\u0027t: the main point I was making is having a useless function that just returns its default parameter and nothing else and is also only used once, so it is superfluous. getting rid of that indirection is a valid solution to the problem.\n\nThe point about making the function do some validation was given as one of the ways keeping the function would make sense. It could ensure that the platforms are really valid strings (but that\u0027s not necessarily, the strings are informational/for human use only, so typos or non-matching values don\u0027t do any real harm.",
