      "message": "This is not a new feature. I see \u0027TextPreRotateAngle\u0027 already in commit 5c4d1b05faa8a from 2012-01-11. And the confusion between text rotation from writing mode \u0027vert\u0027 and text rotation from text area rotation \u0027rot\u0027 has existed ever since. Because the attribute \u0027rot\u0027 has a corresponding attribute for custom shapes in ODF but \u0027vert\u0027 has no corresponding solution in ODF, I first want to clearly separate them in code.\n\nA solution for \u0027vert\u0027 is not straight forward. I had already tried to discuss it on the dev-list, but without real success [How to write OOXML attribute \u0027vert\u0027 of \u003cbodyPr\u003e element to ODF; 2022-06-16]. My current favorite is, to use attribute loext:writing-mode of the graphic properties. That is already used for WritingMode2_BT_LR for frame-shapes. BT_LR corresponds to vert\u003d\"vert270\". But WritingMode2 is not yet directly available for custom shapes.\n\nTherefore I think, it would not be helpful to include ODF import/export in this patch. It is already quite large.",
