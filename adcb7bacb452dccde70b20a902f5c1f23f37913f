      "message": "Just if you call drawNativeControl directly. But this can just happen inside a SalGraphics object, as I made  WidgetDrawInterface protected.\n\nThe real interface is just the uppercase variants of it in SalGraphics.\n\nProbably it could even be private, as there should be no need to call these functions directly, even if you subclass a SalGraphics. They must just be called through the SalGraphics interface from outside.",
