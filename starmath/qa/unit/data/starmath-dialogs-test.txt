# This file contains all dialogs that the unit tests in the module
# will work on if it is in script mode. It will read one-by-one,
# try to open it and create a screenshot that will be saved in
# workdir/screenshots using the pattern of the ui-file name.
#
# Syntax:
# - emty lines are allowed
# - lines starting with '#' are treated as comment
# - all other lines should contain a *.ui filename in the same
#   notation as in the dialog constructors (see code)

#
# The 'known' dialogs which have a hard-coded representation
# in registerKnownDialogsByID/createDialogByID
#

# No known dialogs in starmath for now

#
# Dialogs without a hard-coded representation. These will
# be visualized using a fallback based on VclBuilder
#

# currently deactivated, leads to problems and the test to not work
# This is typically a hint that these should be hard-coded in the
# test case since they need some document and model data to work
