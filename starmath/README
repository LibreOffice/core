Formula editor code for writer ([[sw]]).

Good overview from the original developer:
http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@sw.openoffice.org/msg00200.html

Included font diplomata for using command: font mathbb
Included font rouge script for using command font script
Included font STIX 2 Math for using command setp seth repeat

Why include those fonts?
Diplomata: LO does not have a builtin font for doublestroke. For guaranteeing the work of the command it has to guareantee at least one font of that type.
Rouge script: LO does not have a builtin font for math script. For guaranteeing the work of the command it has to guareantee at least one font of that type.
STIX 2: Open symbol actually has symbols carences (tdf#134214). Some of them where needed to implement etp, seth, repeat, icomplex, eulercte. Those commands where implemented following https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_bold. Only those who wouldn't overflow sal_int16 where implemented as builtin symbols.
