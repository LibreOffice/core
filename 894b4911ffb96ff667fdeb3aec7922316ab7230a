      "message": "I think the theory is that span should be preferred to vector anyway when taking in data as a parameter, since it\u0027s the generic data+size argument that can point to vector but also to whatever else, the same way string_view can for any string.\n\nAnd note that std::span can be constructed directly from std::vector, so you could save the typing if o3tl::span had that too (even only as ctor from std::vector).",
