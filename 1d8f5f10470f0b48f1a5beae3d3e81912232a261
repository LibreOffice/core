      "message": "I\u0027m not very happy about this hardcoded priority between CollectedAddressBook and AddressBook.\n\nHow about instead we remember (when we discovered it in getTableStrings) from which address book the table/view came from, and use that knowledge here?\n\nEssentially, I understand that m_aAddressBook is a misnomer: It is not the address book name, but the table name. I would thus rename it to m_aTableName. *Then* introduce a *new* m_aAddressBook which contains the (name of the) address book that this table comes from. Maybe the next test (\"aAddressBook\") could then become something like:\n\n if (m_aTableName !\u003d m_aAddressBook)\n\n\nAlso, what happens when CollectedAddressBook and AddressBook each contain a list with the same name? Is that supported by Thunderbird (if not, we don\u0027t have a problem)?",
