      "message": "This patch takes in a bit more territory than I am comfortable with. It makes good sense for the MS-lookalike modes, but it isn\u0027t necessary at all for the traditional menu/toolbar.\n\nI just produced it since I mentioned it in a comment and wanted to see how it could be done. Consistency everywhere is nice I guess, and there aren\u0027t that many save options that will exist, so adding one more shouldn\u0027t hurt at all.\n\nBut I couldn\u0027t care less if this is approved or not, so I won\u0027t even bother to self code-review it.",
