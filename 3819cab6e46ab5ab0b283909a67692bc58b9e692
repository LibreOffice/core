      "message": "I see now that this is still used in multiple places where ranges are needed. I suppose that SvxBkgTabPage needs own GetRanges, and should be called with own RID_SVXPAGE_BKG where needed; so that we could get rid of last remnants of SvxBackgroundTabPage class, and its RID.\n\nThe list where RID_SVXPAGE_BACKGROUND is still used is at https://opengrok.libreoffice.org/search?project\u003dcore\u0026full\u003dRID_SVXPAGE_BACKGROUND\u0026si\u003dfull ; see that there are also strings there, which IMO also need to be changed to RID_SVXPAGE_BKG for consistency.\n\nMost of that is for a later commit; but for this one, I believe that SvxBkgTabPage::GetRanges is needed, and RID_SW_TP_BACKGROUND case should use it in the AbstractDialogFactory_Impl::GetTabPageRangesFunc.",
