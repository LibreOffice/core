      "message": "The drawback is that buffer is now forcefully zero-initialized, loosing the opportunity to keep it uninitialized---which had the nice benefit that the consteval ctor would not compile if it failed to write to every element of buffer.  In any case, that \"TODO: drop initialization for C++20\" comment was about exactly this opportunity, and it pertained to the initialization of buffer, not to the initialization of the whole struct.",
