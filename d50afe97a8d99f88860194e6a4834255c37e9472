      "message": "The drawback is that buffer is now forcefully zero-initialized, loosing the opportunity to keep it uninitialized---which had the nice benefit that the consteval ctor would not compile if it failed to write to every element of buffer.  In any case, that \"TODO: drop initialization for C++20\" comment was about exactly this opportunity, and it pertained to the initialization of buffer, not to the initialization of the whole struct.",

      "message": "I was under an impression that there was something in the standard that brace-initialization *zeroes* everything after the explicitly defined values of the initial members - so it looked to me that avoiding the last array piece *should* make no difference. But the stuff is complex, and I indeed could just misunderstand it altogether 😊",
