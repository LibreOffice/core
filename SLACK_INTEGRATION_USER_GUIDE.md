## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Usage

**Q: Can I share unsaved documents?**
A: Yes, the integration captures the current state of your document, even if unsaved.

**Q: What happens if I edit the document after sharing?**
A: The shared version remains unchanged. You'll need to share again to update.

**Q: Can I share the same document to multiple channels?**
A: Currently, you need to repeat the sharing process for each destination.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why do I need to authenticate each time I restart LibreOffice?**
A: Authentication tokens are cached between sessions. You should only need to authenticate once per workspace.

**Q: Can I use this without an internet connection?**
A: No, an active internet connection is required for all Slack communication.

**Q: Are there file size limits?**
A: Yes, Slack imposes file size limits (typically 1GB for paid workspaces, smaller for free plans).

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The Share button is grayed out. Why?**
A: Ensure you're authenticated and have selected a valid channel destination.

**Q: I get "not in channel" errors. What does this mean?**
A: You don't have permission to upload to the selected channel. Try a different channel or ask for an invitation.

**Q: The dialog shows "Failed to load channels."**
A: Check your internet connection and re-authenticate if necessary.
