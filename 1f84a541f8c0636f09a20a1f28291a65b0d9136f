      "message": "Why does this fit better in SectionInfo than in ParaInfo?\n\nBecause a new section doesn\u0027t yet define a new paragraph. So a flag outside of paragraphs is needed anyway to identify the first one. Perhaps ParaInfo ALSO needs a bIsFirstPara to separate out headers/shapes/frames etc, which could reset the SectionInfo flag - making it an internal use flag instead of a public one.\n\nBut there is no example of needing such a thing, so I\u0027m not going to propose to jump immediately to such a complication.",
