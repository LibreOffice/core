      "message": "Commit message should contain major information what this change is about and not (only) classify what kind of project it is and who supports it and why.\n\nAt very least, it should mention, that libtomath was externalized by this commit. Another important aspect that I would mention here is that starting with this commit FB supports building on MSVC 14.0, both 32 and 64 bit (is that correct?). FYI: FB is the only external module that prevents us from dropping support for MSVC 12.0 on master.\n\nAll other changes in FB-LO integration should be mentioned here as well.",

Also it would be nice to report this problem upstream and upload a fix there as well (And link the upstream issue to the UnpackedTarball_firebird.mk file, so that it could be easily dropped when next FB version would fix the issue upstream; see for example external/boost/UnpackedTarball_boost.mk where you can find many issues that were opened by LO developers upstream, e.g.: https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/9885 )? The reason we are trying to do it is: we don\u0027t want to maintain for years the patches for obvious breakages of external projects.",
