      "message": "Well... this implementation first dereferences ustrPath, then ustrFile, if sum of their lengths is too much (so if ustrFile is too long, ustrPath will be deref\u0027d regardless if it\u0027s nullptr); then rtl_uString_newConcat internally requires that at least one of its arguments is non-nullptr. And only then the checks are made if the strings should be released.\n\nAnd - I don\u0027t see how that could be an extension problem. The string passed by user (ustrSystemPath) is dereferenced early; and then it\u0027s only internally allocated ustrFile and ustrPath, that must be created anyway?",
