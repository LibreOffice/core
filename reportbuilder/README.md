Report Builder, or "new style reports", replacing legacy reports (in reportdesign).
Started as an extension called "Sun Report Builder" then "Oracle Report Builder"
[http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/project/reportdesign],
which got bundled with LibreOffice, then converted to an optionally installable
(but installed by default) part of LibreOffice proper.

Uses the Pentaho Reporting Flow Engine of Pentaho BI [http://www.pentaho.com/].
