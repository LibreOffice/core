# Report Builder

Report Builder, or "new style reports", replacing legacy reports (in reportdesign).
Started as an extension called "Sun Report Builder" then "Oracle Report Builder"
<https://extensions.openoffice.org/project/reportdesign>,
which got bundled with LibreOffice, then converted to an optionally installable
(but installed by default) part of LibreOffice proper.

Uses the Pentaho Reporting Flow Engine of Pentaho BI <http://www.pentaho.com/>.
