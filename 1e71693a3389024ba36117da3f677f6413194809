I think that with my original mention of rtl::Uri::convertRelToAbs back in November, I had hoped that we could get rid of aTargetURL as an INetURLObject here, and use the OUString result of rtl::Uri::convertRelToAbs directly in the following code, without turning it into an INetURLObject (which \"damages\" the given URI if it does not match INetURLObject\u0027s idea of what a valid URI should look like).  But it might be a bit hard to replace all that INetURLObject-based querying and modifying (.GetProtocol(), .GetFileExtension(), .hasFinalSlash(), .setExtension(...), .GetMark(...), .GetURLNoMark(...), .SetMark(...)) with functionality based on rtl::Uri and/or UNO\u0027s css.uri stuff.  :(\n\n* I would add a space between \"url\" and \":\".",
