And as you see many pool items don\u0027t have an explicit virtual dtor. If you think that\u0027s bad I would support a uniform solution.\n\nWith the Itanium ABI (as used on Linux and macOS), things like vtables are emitted with the first non-inline virtual function, or weakly everywhere needed when there is no virtual function that\u0027s not inline.  Hence the general recommendation to make at least any virtual dtor non-inline (to ensure there is such a \"key function\").  Can\u0027t be bothered to remember the details for MSVC.\n\n\u003e so far I didn\u0027t encounter a pool item with non DLLPUBLIC member.\n\nWhat do you mean with \"non DLLPUBLIC member\"?\n\n\u003e only saw this once with an other class which gave me a linking error, so I had to define the dtor in the source.\n\nSaw what?",
