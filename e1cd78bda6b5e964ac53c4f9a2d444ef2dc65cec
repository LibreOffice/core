      "message": "I honestly have no idea how much difference does it have to use one or the other. When I saw that it was implemented using the rtl_ustr_reverseCompare_WithLength, I *assumed* it was some approximation of Boyerâ€“Moore algorithm, but I never measured the effect myself. Personally I\u0027d prefer to use some generic algorithm until proven that the \"compare-from-tail\" optimization is effective, but I *supposed* that whoever implemented that, did that research ðŸ˜Š",

      "message": "I wouldn\u0027t rely that much on assuming the code makes sense. Even if it made sense when it was written, which I don\u0027t take as given, it was presumably written in the 80\u0027s/90\u0027s, and times have changed. See e.g. the intro of http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-strfind.html .\n\nAnd I\u0027m not sure from the way you wrote it whether you\u0027re aware or not, but it\u0027s not BM, it\u0027s a plain backwards loop.",
