      "message": "Patchset 2 checks if the cursor is at the end of a paragraph versus not at the start of a paragraph. This works the same to fix the problem of the first character of the next outline paragraph being removed and also allows empty outline paragraphs to be deleted. Checking for the cursor not at the start of a paragraph fails because when a paragraph is empty the cursor is at both the start and end of the paragraph.",
