On the other hand, I don\u0027t want to repeatedly flip the default on master, first because it\u0027d be somewhat annoying to have it changing repeatedly, and secondly disabling it on master might mean that the problem won\u0027t be fixed in a long time, while with it enabled maybe somebody who can reproduce the problem may actually debug and/or fix it.",
