These registers may differ between CPUs and as a consequence these clocks  may  return  bogus\n       results if a process is migrated to another CPU.\n\niow since you introduced a initGlobalTimer (needed for MacOSX anyway)\nyou might as well use CLOCK_REALTIME here and return\nthe delta from the init",
