      "message": "So this splits up some component files into multiple component files for a single shared library (svx/util/crashreport.component broken out of svx/util/svx.component, and sw/util/sw_mm.component broken out of sw/util/sw.component), which then leads in the resulting services rdb file to multiple \u003ccomponent\u003e elements with the same \"uri\" attribute.  While the current implementation in cppuhelper/source/servicemanager.cxx appears to happen to work fine with multiple \u003ccomponent\u003e elements with the same \"uri\" attribute, I\u0027m not really happy with this change:  It opens the door for inconsistencies among the other attributes (\"environment\", \"loader\", \"prefix\") of multiple \u003ccomponent\u003e elements that describe what is conceptionally a single component with a unique \"uri\", and which needs to have unambiguous \"environment\", \"loader\", and \"prefix\" attributes.  I think I would prefer an alternative approach where individual \u003cimplementation\u003e elements in a component file can be marked with some condition, and those conditions are then processed and acted upon when assembling a services rdb file in solenv/gbuild/Rdb.mk and solenv/bin/packcomponents.xslt.",
