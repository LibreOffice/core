      "message": "So this splits up some component files into multiple component files for a single shared library (svx/util/crashreport.component broken out of svx/util/svx.component, and sw/util/sw_mm.component broken out of sw/util/sw.component), which then leads in the resulting services rdb file to multiple \u003ccomponent\u003e elements with the same \"uri\" attribute.  While the current implementation in cppuhelper/source/servicemanager.cxx appears to happen to work fine with multiple \u003ccomponent\u003e elements with the same \"uri\" attribute, I\u0027m not really happy with this change:  It opens the door for inconsistencies among the other attributes (\"environment\", \"loader\", \"prefix\") of multiple \u003ccomponent\u003e elements that describe what is conceptionally a single component with a unique \"uri\", and which needs to have unambiguous \"environment\", \"loader\", and \"prefix\" attributes.  I think I would prefer an alternative approach where individual \u003cimplementation\u003e elements in a component file can be marked with some condition, and those conditions are then processed and acted upon when assembling a services rdb file in solenv/gbuild/Rdb.mk and solenv/bin/packcomponents.xslt.",

And the RDB has just the components built and the workdir/CustomTarget/static/component_maps.cxx has just the existing constructors. No more extra management of solenv/bin/native-code.py, because the input from gbuild is correct. And it\u0027s just managed in gbuild. In theory you have the same logic for the source files then for the component files / snippets.\n\nAs I wrote in the commit message, I wanted to get rid of the duplicated build logic outside of the build system. This is mainly used by the WASM build, which is a stripped down version of LO to \"just\" Writer.\n\nAnd there is a horrible additional patch waiting in feature/wasm to link static binaries from the exposed gbuild info. That can either build LO WASM or link a static soffice.bin + oosplash.",

While somewhat dirty, at least for --enable-dynloading builds that has never caused any actual problems (if any code asked for the instantiation of a service or singleton provided by such an implementation, instead of failing because the service or singleton was unknown, it failed because the implementation could not be loaded; the net effect was about the same).  I assume that does cause whatever problems for your WASM build now, though (and hence you try to address it here).  And trying to clean that up is a good thing anyway.  However:\n\n2.1  This causes the issue of multiple \u003ccomponent\u003e elements in Rdb_services for a single library, as I already explained (and gave suggestions for an alternative solution) in my earlier comment \u003chttps://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/126185/7#message-003096db47859a909f8130ce20cbf31cb5dcdce9\u003e here.\n\n3  Something that is apparently only relevant for --disable-dynloading builds (i.e., the changes to solenv/bin/native-code.py), and which I don\u0027t know anything and can\u0027t say anything about.",
