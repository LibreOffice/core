The Impress slideshow engine

== 3D transitions ==

The 3D transitions are slideshow transition engine using OpenGL and
are located in slideshow/source/engine/OGLTrans/. They were initially
written by GSOC student Shane.M.Mathews. Radek has later polished the
code a bit, added few new 3D transitions, added infrastructure for
vertex and fragment shaders. Wrote few transitions with fragment shader
too.
