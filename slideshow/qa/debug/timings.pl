Timings

=head1 WHAT IT IS

Extract move effect timings from a verbose trace log of the
presentation engine. Generated is a gnuplot data file, which can be
displayed issuing a 'gnuplot <filename>' or at a gnuplot prompt, via
'load <filename>'.

To generate such a verbose log file, rebuild module canvas and module
slideshow with VERBOSE=t defined in the environment, and debug=t at
the build tool command line. Then run the presentation, and redirect
stdout to your log file.

Call me like this: timings.pl < trace-file > gnuplot-target

The whole point in doing this is to detect jerks in shape movements,
which manifest themselves clearly in the graphed gnuplot output. Note
that there's some heuristic to recognize when one effect ends and
another has started: If the time difference between two subsequent
page flipping times is more than one second, a new effect is assumed
and a new gnuplot data record is generated.
