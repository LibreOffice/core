                @param rEndEvent
                Event to be fired, when the activity ends.

                @param rEventQueue
                Queue to add end event to

                @param nMinDuration
                Minimal duration of the activity (might actually be
                longer because of nMinNumberOfFrames). Note that this
                duration must always be the <em>simple</em> duration,
                i.e. without any repeat.

                @param rRepeats
                Number of repeats. If this parameter is invalid,
                infinite repeat is assumed.

                @param nAccelerationFraction
                Value between 0 and 1, denoting the fraction of the
                total simple duration, which the animation should
                accelerate.

                @param nDecelerationFraction
                Value between 0 and 1, denoting the fraction of the
                total simple duration, which the animation should
                decelerate. Note that the ranges
                [0,nAccelerationFraction] and
                [nDecelerationFraction,1] must be non-overlapping!

                @param bAutoReverse
                When true, at the end of the simple duration, the
                animation plays reversed to the start value. Note that
                nMinDuration still specifies the simple duration,
                i.e. when bAutoReverse is true, the implicit duration
                doubles.
