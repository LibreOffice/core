        @param rEndEvent
        Event to be fired, when the activity ends.

        @param rEventQueue
        Queue to add end event to

        @param nMinDuration
        Minimal duration of the activity (might actually be
        longer because of nMinNumberOfFrames). Note that this
        duration must always be the <em>simple</em> duration,
        i.e. without any repeat.

        @param rRepeats
        Number of repeats. If this parameter is invalid,
        infinite repeat is assumed.

        @param nAccelerationFraction
        Value between 0 and 1, denoting the fraction of the
        total simple duration, which the animation should
        accelerate.

        @param nDecelerationFraction
        Value between 0 and 1, denoting the fraction of the
        total simple duration, which the animation should
        decelerate. Note that the ranges
        [0,nAccelerationFraction] and
        [nDecelerationFraction,1] must be non-overlapping!

        @param bAutoReverse
        When true, at the end of the simple duration, the
        animation plays reversed to the start value. Note that
        nMinDuration still specifies the simple duration,
        i.e. when bAutoReverse is true, the implicit duration
        doubles.
