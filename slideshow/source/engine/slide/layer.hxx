        /** This class represents one layer of output on a Slide.

            Layers group shapes for a certain depth region of a slide.

            Since slides have a notion of depth, i.e. shapes on it
            have a certain order in which they lie upon each other,
            this layering must be modelled. A prime example for this
            necessity are animations of shapes lying behind other
            shapes. Then, everything behind the animated shape will be
            in a background layer, the shape itself will be in an
            animation layer, and everything before it will be in a
            foreground layer (these layers are most preferably
            modelled as XSprite objects internally).

            @attention All methods of this class are only supposed to
            be called from the LayerManager. Normally, it shouldn't be
            possible to get hold of an instance of this class at all.
