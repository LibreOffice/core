        /** Interface defining a parametric poly-polygon.

            This interface defines a poly-polygon, whose actual shape
            is parameterized by a floating point value. This is
            e.g. used to generically access the various clip polygon
            generators for transition effects.

            Since for every parametric poly-polygon, there is a set of
            variations, which can easily be generated by simple
            transformations or change in parameter range sweep
            direction, objects implementing this interface only
            generate <em>one</em> prototypical instance of the
            parametric poly-polygon. Generally speaking, the main
            effect direction should be horizontal, it should make
            increasingly more area visible (transition 'in'), and when
            there is a designated direction given, that should be
            left-to-right.

            /** Retrieve the poly-polygon for value t.

                @param t
                Current parameter value to retrieve the corresponding
                poly-polygon for. Permissible values for t must be in
                the range [0,1].

                @return a poly-polygon corresponding to the given
                parameter value. The poly-polygon is interpreted as
                living in the unit rectangle (i.e. [0,1]x[0,1]), but
                is not necessarily constrained to completely lie in
                this area (this very much depends on the actual effect
                to be generated). Although, from a performance
                perspective, it currently <em>is</em> advantageous to
                try to keep the poly-polygon within these bounds (at
                least if there are no hard reasons not to do so),
                because then reversion or out transformations are
                potentially faster to compute (see the
                TransitionInfo::meReverseMethod member in
                transitionfactory.cxx). Furthermore, if one of the
                polygon modifications involve subtraction (also see
                TransitionInfo::meReverseMethod), all generated
                polygons should be oriented clock-wise
                (i.e. traversing the polygon vertices with increasing
                vertex index should generate a clock-wise movement).
