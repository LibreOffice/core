/** This class schedules user-activated events.

    This class registeres at the EventMultiplexer and fires
    events registered for certain user actions. Note that all
    events will not be fired immediately after the user action
    occurred, but always added to the EventQueue (and fired the
    next time that queue is processed). Which is actually a
    feature.

    Conceptually, an event is an object that typically is
    fired only once. After that, the event is exhausted, and
    should be discarded. Therefore, all events registered on
    this object are fired and then all references to them are
    removed.

        @param rEventMultiplexer
        The slideshow-global event source, where this class
        registeres its event handlers.

        @param rEventQueue
        Reference to the main event queue. Since we hold this
        object by plain reference, it must live longer than we
        do. On the other hand, that queue must not fire events
        after this object is destroyed, since we might
        schedule events there which itself contain plain
        references to this object. Basically, EventQueue and
        UserEventQueue should have the same lifetime, and since
        this is not possible, both must be destructed in a
        phased mode: first clear both of any remaining events,
        then destruct them.
