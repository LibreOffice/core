                This method creates a new layer for shape attributes,
                which lies atop of all previous attribute layers. That
                is most typically used when a new SMIL animation
                starts (which according to the spec always lies atop
                of all previous animations). Thus, subsequent calls to
                this method generate a sandwich of attribute layers,
                which in total define the shape's attributes.

                Please note that the attribute layers do <em>not</em>
                contain the underlying XShape's attributes as
                default. Instead, attributes not explicitly set by

                override the underlying graphical shape
                representation. XShape attributes must be passed
