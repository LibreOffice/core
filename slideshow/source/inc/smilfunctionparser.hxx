            /** Parse a string containing a SMIL value.

                This method parses a string representing
                a fixed value (i.e. a value that does not
                change by time). Due to the dynamic view
                capabilities of the presentation engine,
                this value can sometimes only be determined
                during runtime of the animation (because
                e.g. mixed screen/view coordinates are
                involved), and is thus still returned as an
                ExpressionNode object. An example for
                such a case is the "Width+1.0" string, which
                contains the width of the shape in user
                coordinate space, and the screen width
                in device coordinate space.

                The following grammar is accepted by this method:
                <code>
               identifier = 'pi'|'e'|'X'|'Y'|'Width'|'Height'

               function = 'abs'|'sqrt'|'sin'|'cos'|'tan'|'atan'|'acos'|'asin'|'exp'|'log'

                                number |

                                '(' additive_expression ')'

                                   '-' basic_expression |

                                                   ( '/' unary_expression )* )
