            revocation of shape subsets. Shape subsets are shapes that
            represent (and animate) only parts of an original's shape
            content.

                This method queries a new (but not necessarily unique)
                shape, which displays only the given subset of the
                original one. Calling this method multiple times with
                the same original shape and DocTreeNode content always
                returns the same shape.

                Requesting a subset from an original shape leads to
                the original shape ceasing to display the subsetted
                content. In other words, shape content is always
                displayed in exactly one shape.
