            This class wraps the plain Shape with a wrapper for subset
            functionality. Subsetting can be turned on and off. Note
            that the reason to have shape subsetting RAII implemented
            separately (i.e. not within the DrawShape) was that
            subsetting (and de-subsetting) needs the
            SubsettableShapeManager. And holding that at the DrawShape
            creates one heck of a circular reference.
