            This class handles and synchronizes screen updates
            centrally. Therefore, it can hold a number of ViewUpdate
            objects, which are polled for pending updates on
            commitUpdates(). Furthermore, external code can request
            updates via notifyUpdate() calls. If neither such an
            update was requested, nor any of the registered ViewUpdate
            objects report any pending update, commitUpdates() does
            nothing.
