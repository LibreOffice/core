            This function generates a pair of events, that are
            especially tailored to achieve the following behaviour: By
            default, the given functor is called after the specified
            timeout (after insertion of the event into the EventQueue,
            of course). But optionally, when the interruption event
            InterruptableEventPair::mpImmediateEvent is fired, the
            given functor is called <em>at once</em>, and the delay is
            ignored (that means, the given functor is guaranteed to be
            called at utmost once, and never twice. Furthermore, it is
            ensured that both events return false on isCharged(), once
            anyone of them has been fired already).

            @param rFunctor
            Functor to call when the event fires.

            @param nTimeout
            Timeout in seconds, to wait until functor is called.

            @returns a pair of events, where the first one waits the
            specified amount of time, and the other fires the given
            functor immediately.
