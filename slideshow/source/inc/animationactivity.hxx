                Since attribute layers can only be generated when the
                animation starts, the Activity owner must be able to
                pass it into the Activity after initial creation. The
                same applies to the actual shape the animation must
                run for, since e.g. subsetted shapes are generated
                close before the animation starts, too (this is not
                necessary in and out of itself, but for performance
                reasons. Otherwise, character iterations produce tons
                of subset shapes).

                @param rShape
                Shape to play the animation on.

                @param rAttrLayer
                Attribute layer to change the animated values on.
