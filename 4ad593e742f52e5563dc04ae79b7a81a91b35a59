      "message": "Eh, nope, this is not the right way to do it. \n\nNormally you append your SIDs after the last valid SID (SID_EDIT_POSTIT in this particular case) and then adapt SID_SVX_FIRSTFREE to point at now-last item\n\nBut irrelevant anyway, see the other comment explaning why it is a bad idea to have those slots in svx",
