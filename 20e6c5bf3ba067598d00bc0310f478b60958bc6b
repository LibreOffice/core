      "message": "With this code, video overlay during the slideshow is oddly misplaced with generic X11 vclplug (SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN\u003dgen) and now also with kde5 one.\n\nIt\u0027s as if its position was transled twice: once relative to the top-left corner of the slide and second time relative to the embedded window. If I remove this code, overlay position is back to normal.",
