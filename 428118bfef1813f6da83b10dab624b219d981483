      "message": "Bit concerned about this one. Is this code not shared with the pixel dialogs we render ? that is not the sidebar in co-2021 of course - but lots of eg. format-\u003echaracter type dialogs.\n\nIs it possible we are dropping important invalidations there ? and/or can we detect the window type from the window and drop invalidations of those ? also curious about in-sheet controls which may also use the same code-paths.\n\nThanks!",

      "message": "This commit is really an extension of T28236 (kill idle painting). AFAICT these invalidations are ignored later on anyway because of idle painting not taking place.\n\nAll tests pass, and I do not see any problems when trying at random (Format-\u003eCharacter seems to work fine), so unless you have a specific problem or area to test, I don\u0027t know what to do more here.",
