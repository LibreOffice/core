Is this code not shared with the pixel dialogs we render ? that is not the sidebar in co-2021 of course - but lots of eg. format-\u003echaracter type dialogs.\n\nIs it possible we are dropping important invalidations there ? and/or can we detect the window type from the window and drop invalidations of those ? also curious about in-sheet controls which may also use the same code-paths.\n\nThanks!",
