      "message": "I think introducing SolarMutexReleaser::clear makes the code less readable and maintainable, not more.  For a \"guard\" object like aReleaser it is important to easily determine the range of code it guards, and the easiest way to do that is with a block:\n\n  Reference\u003cdatatransfer::XTransferable\u003e xDataObj;\n  {\n    SolarMutexReleaser aReleaser;\n    xDataObj \u003d xClipboard-\u003egetContents();\n  }\n\n(And especially so for SolarMutexReleaser, where each use of it is a gross hack.  It is actually a good thing to have these hacks stand out like ugly warts in the code.)",
