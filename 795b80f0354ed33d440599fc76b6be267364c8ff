      "message": "\u003e so i thought if you copy the file manually anyway you might as well run this script before copying it...\n\nIt\u0027s not that I literally copy the file from here to github, but rather that I diff the two and then sync them manually, as changes are flowing in both directions.  But yeah, keeping this file in sync with download.lst has always been a bit of a pain, and I don\u0027t really want to burden that pain on others (\"if I change download.lst, do I need to remember to modify solenv/flatpak-manifest.in too?\"), so I\u0027m more than fine with this change.  Thanks!",
