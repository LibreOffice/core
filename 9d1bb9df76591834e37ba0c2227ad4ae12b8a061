      "message": "This indeed is a hack.\n\nThe problem here is that in case of opening the document normally, the password gets asked long before WriterFilter::filter is invoked, in filter detection; so the encryption data is already in media descriptor in SfxObjectShell::ImportFrom. When recovering, no filter detection happens, so the encryption data is not there.\n\nThe magic happens in FilterDetect::extractUnencryptedPackage, where utl::MediaDescriptor::requestAndVerifyDocPassword is called, and then its result is added back to the media descriptor. Possibly we could do that somewhere up the call stack in the recovery case?",
