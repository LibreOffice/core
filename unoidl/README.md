Support for UNOIDL registry formats

Library_unoidl contains the unoidl::Manager and unoidl::Provider implementations
for the following registry formats:

* The new UNOIDL binary types.rdb format.
* The old legacy binary types.rdb format (based on modules [[store]] and
  [[registry]]).
* A source-file format, reading (multiple) UNOIDL entity definitions directly
  from a single .idl source file.
* A source-tree format, reading UNOIDL entity definitions directly from a tree
  of .idl source files rooted at a given directory.  (Where an entity named
  foo.bar.Baz is expected in a file named foo/bar/Baz.idl within that tree.)

(While .idl files still contain #include directives for legacy idlc, the source-
based formats ignore any preprocessing directives starting with "#" in the .idl
files.)  unoidl::Manager::addProvider transparently detects the registry format
for a given URI and instantiates the corresponding provider implementation.

Executable_unoidl-write is a helper tool to convert from any of the registry
formats to the UNOIDL format.  It is used at build-time to compile UNOIDL format
.rdb files (that are used at build-time only, or included in installation sets
in URE or program/types/ or as part of bundled extensions that are created
during the build and not merely included as pre-built .oxt files) from source
.idl files.  (The SDK still uses idlc and generates legacy format .rdb files for
now.)

Executable_unoidl-read is a helper tool to convert from any of the registry
formats to the source-file format.  It can be used manually after a LibreOffice
version update to create new reference registries for Executable_unoidl-check.

Executable_unoidl-check is a helper tool to check that one registry is
backwards-compatible with another registry.  It is used at build-time to detect
inadvertent breakage of the udkapi and offapi APIs.

== Specification of the new UNOIDL types.rdb format ==

The format uses byte-oriented, platform-independent, binary files.  Larger
quantities are stored LSB first, without alignment requirements.  Offsets are
32 bit, effectively limiting the overall file size to 4GB, but that is not
considered a limitation in practice (and avoids unnecessary bloat compared to
64 bit offsets).

Annotations can be added for (non-module) entities and certain parts of such
entities (e.g., both for an interface type definition and for a direct method of
an interface type definition; the idea is that it can be added for direct parts
that forma a "many-to-one" relationship; there is a tradeoff between generality
of concept and size of representation, esp. for the C++ representation types in
namespace unoidl) and consist of arbitrary sequences of name/value strings.
Each name/value string is encoded as a single UTF-8 string containing a name (an
arbitrary sequence of Unicode code points not containing U+003D EQUALS SIGN),
optionally followed by U+003D EQUALS SIGN and a value (an arbitrary sequence of
Unicode code points).  The only annotation name currently in use is "deprecated"
(without a value).

The following definitions are used throughout:

* UInt16: 2-byte value, LSB first
* UInt32: 4-byte value, LSB first
* UInt64: 8-byte value, LSB first
* Offset: UInt32 value, counting bytes from start of file
* NUL-Name: zero or more non-NUL US-ASCII bytes followed by a NUL byte
* Len-String: UInt32 number of characters, with 0x80000000 bit 0, followed by
   that many US-ASCII (for UNOIDL related names) resp. UTF-8 (for annotations)
   bytes
* Idx-String: either an Offset (with 0x80000000 bit 1) of a Len-String, or a
   Len-String
* Annotations: UInt32 number N of annotations followed by N * Idx-String
* Entry: Offset of NUL-Name followed by Offset of payload
* Map: zero or more Entries

The file starts with an 8 byte header, followed by information about the root
map (unoidl-write generates files in a single depth-first pass, so the root map
itself is at the end of the file):

* 7 byte magic header "UNOIDL\xFF"
* version byte 0
* Offset of root Map
* UInt32 number of entries of root Map
...

Files generated by unoidl-write follow that by a

  "\0** Created by LibreOffice " LIBO_VERSION_DOTTED " unoidl-write **\0"

banner (cf. config_host/config_version.h.in), as a debugging aid.  (Old versions
used "reg2unoidl" instead of "unoidl-write" in that banner.)
