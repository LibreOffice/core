      "message": "I am sorry for creating a confusion.\nThe problem seems to be not in the LoadAndRegisterEmbeddedDataSource, where the vnd.sun.star.pkg URL is created *properly*, but in this place that you already identified while debugging. I told you that \"rEvent.OldLocation string was *incorrectly* URL-encoded twice\" - but obviously that was a wrong statement; instead, aOwnURL creation should be changed to also use *proper* procedure. To do that, ConstructVndSunStarPkgUrl needs to be moved to the beginning of this file.\n\nPlease see https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/44917/, where I myself explicitly replaced WithCharset with NONE in lcl_getOwnURL - because this is how the URL must be created: the canonical URL representation (i.e., URL-encoded where appropriate) gets passed to the createVndSunStarPkgUrlReference to create second-level URL, so second URL-encoding is expected and correct.\n\nAgain, excuse for the confusion caused.",
