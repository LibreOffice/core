At this point it\u0027s beyond my skills.",

      "message": "There is a conceptional mismatch here.  The place where those C++ exceptions are thrown is part of the URE and does not know about LibreOffice (so it shouldn\u0027t mention \"Tools - Options - Advanced\"), and such exception messages are generally intended for developers rather than for end users (and should not be translated).\n\nThat the code in ExtensionCmdQueue::Thread::execute (desktop/source/deployment/gui/dp_gui_extensioncmdqueue.cxx) uses such exception messages and displays them to the user is somewhat unfortunate.  (It could display that data as \"more detailed information\" alongside some more user-centric message, though.)  A fix for tdf#112723 \"Java-based extension installation leads to unhelpful error message when Java is not present or not found\" should thus better address the place where the exception message is consumed rather than where it is produced.",
