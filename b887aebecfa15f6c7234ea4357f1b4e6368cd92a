      "message": "As far as I see the testcase doesn\u0027t enter this branch, as the sHint is \"99\" (without quotes).\n\nSo I\u0027m just trying to understand: if you want to drop the surrounding quotes, why don\u0027t you do copy(1, getLength() - 2)? I don\u0027t get why it\u0027s -3.\n\nAlso, as asked previously, please add a \u0026\u0026 getLength() \u003e\u003d 2 check, otherwise if sHint is just \u0027\"\u0027, you\u0027ll access the 2nd char of a string which is only of 1 char.",
