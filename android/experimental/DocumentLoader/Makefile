# We can't keep assuming APP_DATA_PATH like this, surely this can vary with
# Android versions and whatnot, this is temporary and works at least with the
# SDK 16 emulator...

# Probably would be best to just stop fooling around with the possibilities to
# set various stuff with the -env command line parameters (and environment
# variables?) and in a plethora of rc files, and hardcode construction of
# *all* required pathnames based on the app installation location for Android
# (and iOS), etc. We don't really win anything by having so many layers of
# configurability on platforms like Android and iOS where apps based on LO
# code are very much self-contained pre-packaged thingies.
