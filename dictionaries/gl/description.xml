    <!-- A unique identifier for your extension.
        In order to avoid name clashes with other extensions it should probably hold
        your company name or your full name along with the name of the extension in a form like
            MyFirstName.MyLastName.DictionayName
        or  www.MyWebpage.net.DictionayName
        Or  you may use the project name of your submitted extension to start with...
        For the very same reason they should NOT start with 'org.openoffice'.
        When choosing the identifier keep in mind that others may provide a dictionary for that
        very same language as well and even then your identifier still needs to be unique! -->

        For dictionaries it should show the locales supported
        and the purpose spell checking and/or hyphenation and/or thesaurus.
        The display name can be localized and there should be at least one
        entry for each language it implements and one default English entry.
        The default entry is the one listed first. -->
