I meant that we don\u0027t need to limit the name to 31 characters, only to 256; and let FB to do the rest (check 31-char limit).\n\nOur check it *necessary*, because user *can* specify a long username in config. \nThat would mean that arbitrarily long 4-byte integer would be passed into push_back; it will be converted to char; e.g., 1025 would get converted to 1; this would mean that FB will read 1 character of the name, and then read the next character as type; what it will get there is undefined; it may well result in a read after the buffer.\n\nSo please make sure to limit the user name to the *maximum allowed by the data format* (i.e., fitting into 1 byte).",
