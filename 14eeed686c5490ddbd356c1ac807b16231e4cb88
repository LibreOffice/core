Feels more natural then made up names. gbuild OTOH is not really consistent in the $(gb_MKTEMP) usage.\n\nbikeshedding / YMMV: I think $(gb_MKTEMP) should be the preference, even if it calls a program and therefore will be a bit slower.",

(My qualms with gb_MKTEMP are that it makes it harder to debug build issues by obscuring the actual file names and easily fills TMPDIR with garbage if e.g. a recipe fails in the middle of a ... \u0026\u0026 ... \u0026\u0026 ... chain and thus never gets to the rm---which is less of an issue if the temporary file has a well-known name in WORKDIR, where it gets overwritten by the next build and/or removed by `make clean`.)",
