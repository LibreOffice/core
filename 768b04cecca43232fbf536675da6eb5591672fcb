      "message": "All other places include \"GLTF.h\" before other headers, and I guess this sequence was the reason, why the stdlib headers were also included in the GLTF/GLTFExtraDataHandler.h\n\nTherefore I simply reorganized the following includes. The buildbots succeeded, but I didn\u0027t chek, if all build with collada.\n\nAFAIK no other code includes any stdlib or even \"GLTF.h\"  in a header, so the other headers don\u0027t work on their own without \"GLTF.h\" anyway.",
