      "message": "The value returned by AquaSalInstance::getOSVersion is also used in the \"About LibreOffice\" dialog, and use of the name \"Macintosh\" looks rather dated there (\"Around [the late 1990\u0027s], Apple phased out the Macintosh name in favor of \u0027Mac\u0027\", according to \u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh\u003e).  If use of \"Macintosh\" is relevant for Calc\u0027s INFO(\"OSVERSION\") (e.g., for compatibility with Excel), I would suggest using different functions to obtain the relevant values for Calc and for the \"About LibreOffice\" dialog.  If the use of \"Macintosh\" is not relevant there, I would suggest changing to something like \"Mac\" or \"macOS\" (the value returned by AquaSalInstance::getOSVersion prior to this change contained \"Mac OS X\", but which is outdated also).",

      "message": "Also, thinking about it some more, I\u0027m not sure whether it is better for the \"About LibreOffice\" dialog to mention the actual CPU architecture or the current process\u0027s target architecture (which can be different when running an x86-64 soffice on M1 via Rosetta).  The original value prior to this change avoided that question by mentioning neither.",
