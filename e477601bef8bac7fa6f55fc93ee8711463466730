      "message": "I totally agree with the way how you chose the names for these parts of the complex property: \"BorderInnerLineWidth\" etc - please keep them; this will allow to provide different translations for different properties that might have similar names in English, but need different naming in other languages (? I imagine that\u0027s possible). However, for the user-visible English string, we may omit the \"Border\" word, because they will be under the parent node, which *needs own name*, and will help understand border of what is meant:\n\n    ...\n    Border\n        Color\n        Inner Line Width\n        ...\n\ninstead of\n\n    ...\n    Border\n        Border Color\n        Border Inner Line Width\n        ...",
