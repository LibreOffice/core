      "message": "Is this the best way to handle converting the endnote to footnote? I looked up static_cast / dynamic_cast, but google wasn\u0027t completely helpful. Would it be better to do a \"const SwFootnote* pFootnoteInfo \u003d dynamic_cast\u003cconst SwFootnoteInfo*(\u0026info)\"? Then I could verify that I don\u0027t have a nullptr, and that the cast really did work.  Without this I am trusting that no one will send EndNoteInfo along with a XML_footnotePr tag.",
