      "message": "In MS Word (at least in Word 2010), changing line height does not affect the first line indent value.\n\nHowever our behaviour here is not a compatibility issue - even if we change the first line indent upon line height change, it is still fine because in the saved DOCX the updated indent is used; and upon fileopen the first line indent value as written by the creator application is there. The only problem is the one described in tdf#129448: If I set first line indent to \"2 Characters\" and then suppose it calculates an indent value of 0.68cm, then when the line height is changed then the first line indent is changed to a much bigger value which is not the user wanted. Even for other languages, for instance English, line height is line height and first line indent is first line indent, why should the first line indent be changed in case of line height change?",

      "message": "Hmm, https://help.libreoffice.org/7.4/en-US/text/shared/01/05030100.html states that automatic indent depends on the font size and line spacing, so this seems to be intentional. However, ODF 1.3, 20.246 style:auto-text-indent indeed says that this depends only on the font size. I believe you can only change this if you add a compat flag to not break old documents, but I\u0027m a bit unsure if the benefit of that tiny ODF conformance outweighs the cost of one more compat flag.\n\nLooping in Regina and Michael to hear they input.",

I think now I understand what a capability flag is: for a new document this flag is written into settings.xml, and there is no such flag in old documents so that the deletion of those rows related to line-height will not have effect on old documents.\n\nBut I have one question: How about old docx/doc files? How about any (new or old) doc/docx documents created by MS Word? Since in Word the line height is not considered when setting the first line indent, I think we should also not consider that, even though there is no such capability flag, correct? In other words, we should only check this flag for ODF files, not any other files (for other file formats the new behaviour of first line indent should apply without any preconditions), am I correct? If this is the case, I think I need to learn more.\n\nAnyway, I can try to add such flag without considering the doc/docx issue above, and add improvements afterwards. This may take some time for me to learn.",
