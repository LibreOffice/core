      "message": "Absolutely :) I also think about that all the time.\n\nI remember that you tried to rectify this, but had to abandon that attempt (do I remember correctly?). Was it because of some file format storing the raw rectangle? And wouldn\u0027t it make sense to special-case that format handling, if that was the case?",

      "message": "Yes, we store it into the SVM file format I think. Yes, it would sense to do that. It is rather unfortunate, because that file format is used as an intermediate stage in our processing quite a lot.\n\nWhat would be ideal (IMO) is\n(*) use (x,y,width,height) in tools::Rectangle and through the magic value away.\n(*) use the versioning mechanism in SVM to add some data to certain records whenever we hit this problem.",
