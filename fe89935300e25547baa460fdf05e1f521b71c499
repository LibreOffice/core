      "message": "Not sure I actually understand this correctly, was first confused by the \"is correctly positioned because ... wrongly takes into account ...\".\n\nAfter looking at the change, I understand it like:\n\"Currently the help window in Calc is correctly positioned in qt5, since the qt5 backend takes the native menu bar into account when positioning frames (as added in commit 337b592a721bef2c54cbe8c4927e5cc5a68c2138 which fixed tdf#123779).\n\nHowever, that handling is incorrect in general. As a result, moving of undocked toolbars is handled incorrectly.\n\nSo add the offset to the help positioning instead.\"\n\n(i.e. add offset in another place that is more appropriate than where 337b592a721bef2c54cbe8c4927e5cc5a68c2138 had put it)\n\nIs that understanding correct?",

I think the correct solution would be to use the maGeometry.n*Decoration stuff. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t have posted it uncommented. The whole \"help\" is yet an other hack on top of the hack in b15f6e3388eb031f2c57d21f0ea109f90e4e3c61, which is used by gtk3 and qt5. I think the right solution would be to adapt maGeometry.nTopDecoration for the case of the native menu bar, because you can\u0027t paint on it and it decreases the window size. I wouldn\u0027t spend to much time on this patch.\n\nThe wording means just, that the help positioning looks ok, but the internal handling still is wrong, resulting in the wrong dock behaviour. I just wanted to give you an idea, what doesn\u0027t work, because I already spend time on it.\n\nAnyway, the whole positioning code in LO must somehow take the native menubar into account. Without this hack to fix tdf#130841. The whole code is just a stack of hacks, which papers over the problem with internally using two different window sizes.",
