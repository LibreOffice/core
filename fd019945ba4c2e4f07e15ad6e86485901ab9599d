      "message": "In non-placeable wmf I think it\u0027s not possible to tell the size without playing back the file. The non-placeable header doesn\u0027t seem to have a size property like the placeable header does (BoundingBox, Inch).\n\nThis means the placeable test *could* use a size test. ImpDetectWMF doesn\u0027t currently set the size metadata. I\u0027ll have to add that when we move to using GraphicFormatDetector.\n\nFor now this test should be fine. I can open the placeable wmf on my machine correctly with this patch.",

Add the instruction to run the test in the commit message:\n  make CPPUNIT_TEST_NAME\u003d\"testDetectWMF\" -sr CppunitTest_vcl_graphic_test\n3. Add a comment to the code where the test fails without the fix in place\n// Without the fix, equality assertion fails with: - Expected: 246 - Actual  : 0\n4. Use emfio/qa/cppunit/wmf/data/tdf88163-non-placeable.wmf as the nonplaceable wmf file in the test, as TypeDetectionExample.wmf is tested elsewhere.",
