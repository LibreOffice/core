      "message": "In non-placeable wmf I think it\u0027s not possible to tell the size without playing back the file. The non-placeable header doesn\u0027t seem to have a size property like the placeable header does (BoundingBox, Inch).\n\nThis means the placeable test *could* use a size test. ImpDetectWMF doesn\u0027t currently set the size metadata. I\u0027ll have to add that when we move to using GraphicFormatDetector.\n\nFor now this test should be fine. I can open the placeable wmf on my machine correctly with this patch.",
