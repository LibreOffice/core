To get one gbuild instance build only (tail_build only), migrating the "real" 
module should be the enough for a start. I assume extras, setup_native, 
readlicense not being depended upon by anything other than scp2 (so they could 
be run after tail_build for now). So bridges, soltools, sysui, cli_ure are the 
ones that should allow us to do a 'complete' gbuild-only build, if anyone is 
looking for the 'important' remaining modules.
