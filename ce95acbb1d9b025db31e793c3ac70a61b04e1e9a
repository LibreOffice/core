So in more obvious terms, the grep for CreateMessageDialog found ~500 hits. Currently they are just stored in unique_ptr, but when we switch these to async, they face the same problem and adding all these ~250 files (git grep -l CreateMessageDialog | wc -l), seems not remotely a sensible idea. So yes, I saw the lists in the plugin and I would be fine, if I would just add my new single file, which would work ATM... OTOH this just handles the weld::MessageDialog. I have no way to know, if these are the only ones. A lot more dialogs (and PopupMenus) need async handling.\n\nI could just return a shared_ptr from CreateMessageDialog to begin with. The bit of overhead should be neglectable, because this just creates a GUI dialog and that is not fast anyway. But I\u0027m still asking, if there is a clang-plugin-based solution, other then disabling it or whitelisting IMHO huge amounts of files.",
