      "message": "It is pointless to print such warnings in a production build. Nobody will see them and there is nothing the user can do about it anyway. Use SAL_WARN, and it will be seen only in a development build. (That doesn\u0027t guarantee anybody does anything about it anyway, though, as can be seen from the tons of warning one gets when running a development build.)",
