      "message": "Generally in EMF+ there special record: EmfPlusGetDC, which is very important for Dual mode.\nIt specifies that specifies that subsequent EMF records encountered in the metafile must be processed.\n\nMaybe to handle this we could change following line to:\n\n            else if ( mbEMFPlusDualMode \u0026\u0026 !bHaveDC \u0026\u0026 nRecType !\u003d EMR_HEADER \u0026\u0026 nRecType !\u003d EMR_EOF )\n\nWith this solution, we will process EMF, if GetDC was found.\n\nAs I understand the GetDC should be taken to accound also for DualMode.",
