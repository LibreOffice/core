      "message": "After a few attempts, I went for a simple fix, for a few reasons:\n- the similar \"64-bit\" types one could\u0027ve switched to, like tools::Rectangle are only 64-bit in 64-bit builds,\n- the scope of type change spills over to further classes, involving more UNO calls and more headache,\n- this minimal change is easy to backport, and to follow up on in the future.\n\nEike, can you please review?",

      "message": "Instead of quadruplicating the same ternary expression at different places please create a local inline function that does this and can be changed later in that one central place to handle 64-bit values. Also adding a SAL_WARN() as Lubo≈° mentioned sounds like a good idea.",
