Probably not all of them are necessary.\n\n- the whole solution works only when you save as XLSX in LO. But it doesn\u0027t work when you run LO as converter:\n./scalc.exe --convert-to xlsx %%f --outdir sub_folder\n\nin this case only sheet name is renamed. But all cells formulars use old-original sheet names.",
