      "message": "Looks like it works fine for me as well, as well as for a bit more testing in real conditions, thanks!\n\nI don\u0027t have much feedback on the code change itself (and admit I didn\u0027t dig deep reviewing the code).  However, I\u0027m really not sure that the whole \"a11y children off view are discarded\" makes sense.  It\u0027s a pain for a11y users, and AFAICT in the case of Impress it only ever shows 1 page at a time, and only presents that page to a11y, so additionally collecting children further don\u0027t seem very useful for performance to me.\nIf really not all pages and content should be presented (which could be a performance issue for very large documents indeed), I would think that having pages at the root of the document (and them FLOWing_TO/FROM one to the next) and all visible pages being fully populated would be fine, simpler and better for consumers.\n\nBut as a fix, your changes sounds good.\n\n\u003e Are you planning to make use of that in follow-up a11y tests (in which case I\u0027d not spend time thinking on whether I should be adding any tests myself ;-))?\n\nYes and no, I didn\u0027t plan specifically writing anything for Draw/Impress but to check which helpers could be useful, and what would be useful to reuse; but I could do that nonetheless.  I have tried your changes also with an additional test case that has 2 pages and switches back and forth between them to test that part as well as the loading.  I can either submit that here or in a follow up.  It currently uses https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/137337 though, and I\u0027m not sure how I can submit that before yours is merged (I tried submitting after cherry-picking yours on top of mine, and it tells me I\u0027m not allowed to do that).",
