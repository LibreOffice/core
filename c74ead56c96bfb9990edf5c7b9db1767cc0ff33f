      "message": "Please format this comment block:\n\n1. Split lines shorter, so that the last character does not extend past position 100;\n2. Make it a single comment (either by using *one single* pair of /* .. */ around the whole block, or by using //-style comments, instead of the three comments).\n3. Let\u0027s clarify this sentence:\n\n  Because, in windows file system, paths are case-sensitive\n\nIt may be confusing. There is a case-preservation, that is always active (names are stored on storage preserving the case used on creation); there is case sensitivity on the filesystem (and kernel) level; there is an *option* to use case sensitivity on Win32 subsystem level. What is relevant *here* is that the paths are compared case-sensitively *in LibreOffice code*, which provides robustness and uniformity, but requires that we use correct and *consistent* case for all parts of paths, *including* drive letters, which happens to not be processed by GetLongPathNameW. So I suggest something like:\n\n  Windows file paths are processed case-sensitively\n\n4. Please drop the \"previously our built-in getCaseCorrectPath covered this case\" - it will not help a reader in the future to know that at some point it was different: what is important is to describe why it is so now.",
