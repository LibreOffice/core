    /** helper class composing requests to a ->XObjectInspectorUI interface, coming
        from multiple sources

        Usually, a handler tells the browser UI to enable to disable, or show or hide, certain
        elements. Now when multiple handlers do this, their instructions must be combined:
        If one handler disables a certain element, but others enable it, it must in the
        result still be disabled. Similar for showing/hiding elements.

        ->ComposedPropertyUIUpdate implements this combination. It does so by providing a dedicated
        ->XObjectInspectorUI instance for every participating handler, and remembering the UI
        state on a per-handler basis. Upon request (->fire), the combined UI state is
        forwarded to another ->XObjectInspectorUI instance, the so-called delegator UI.

            firing is suspended, only explicit ->fire calls trigger the notification to the

            Note that calls to ->suspendAutoFire are culmulative, that is, if you make multiple calls
            they must be accompanied by an equal number of calls to ->resumeAutoFire, to enable
            auto-firing again.
