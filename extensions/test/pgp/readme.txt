The program TestPGP instantiates a SimplePGPMailerFactory and adds
 it to the ServiceManager obtained from a running StarOffice.
Then PGP can be used from within StarOffice.

Prerequisites:
StarOffice needs an entry in Office/user/sofficerc under the Common
 section:

 Port2=socket:hamburg-11070:1111 // old style
as of 569 m
Connection=socket,hamburg-11070,port=1111;iiop;

Please note the semicolons!

 hamburg-11070 is the host running the office and 1111 is a
 freely choosable port number.


 For the program to run make sure that the office has access
 to classes.zip, unoil.jar, jurt.jar, pgp.jar and swingall.jar.

 Therefore do the necessary entries in
 Office/user/config/javarc
 under SystemClasspath.

There is a bug with jdk1.1.8, therefore use 1.2 instead.

The TestPGP is called without ;iiop; :

java TestPGP "socket,host=localhost,port=1111"
