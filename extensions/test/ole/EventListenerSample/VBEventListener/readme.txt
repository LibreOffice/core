VBasicEventListener.dll is an ActiveX component written with VisualBasic. The
component registers on the system with a particular ID. When the library is build 
this ID is generated, unless a previously build library exists. Then the ID of that 
library is used. In order to use always the same ID, the library must be as binary in
the cvs.

The library can be used under the licences noted in VBEventListener.cls.
