This module contains a grab-bag of unrelated misc. libraries, *none* of which is an extension.

== Application online update checking ==

When we start LO, first InitUpdateCheckJobThread is created, via
UpdateCheckJob::execute() (from extensions/source/update/check/updatecheckjob.cxx),
as a reaction to a "onFirstVisibleTask" event. It waits 25 seconds (so that it
does not interfere with the startup itself), and then calls
UpdateCheck::initialize() (from extensions/source/update/check/updatecheck.cxx).

This creates one more thread, UpdateCheckThread, that regularly checks whether
we have reached the time when we should ask for the update.  If yes, asks for
that, and shows the download button in the menu (if the new update is
available).

== OLE automation bridge ==

A bridge between "OLE automation" and UNO, so you can use UNO services
from JScript, VBScript, etc.

https://www.openoffice.org/udk/common/man/spec/ole_bridge.html

See udkapi/com/sun/star/bridge/oleautomation/ApplicationRegistration.idl

This is initialized in Desktop::Main() in Desktop::OpenClients_Impl()
by creating the service "com.sun.star.bridge.OleApplicationRegistration",
which is implemented by ole_adapter::OleServer_Impl.

See extensions/source/ole/

== ActiveX control ==

This allows embedding LO into a Win32 application as an ActiveX control.
See extensions/source/activex/

== Spotlight provider ==

On Mac OS X, this allows indexing ODF documents with Spotlight.
See extensions/source/macosx/spotlight/

== Scanner support ==

You can scan from LibreOffice, using platform specific backends like TWAIN/SANE.
See extensions/source/scanner/
