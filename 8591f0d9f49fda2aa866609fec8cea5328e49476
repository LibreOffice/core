      "message": "I admit I am not that proficient with C++, and I an unsure if this would call a ctor taking a single int - creating a vector consisting of nNewTab elements, each initialized to 0?\n\nCould you please check (maybe put an assert for the expected size, and then assert(false)) to make sure the code is executed/checked?\n\nOr maybe put the initializer list inside parentheses? Will it make a difference? I am really confused with the multitude of the initialization variants in C++ :-)",
