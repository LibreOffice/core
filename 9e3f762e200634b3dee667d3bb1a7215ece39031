      "message": "this all seems to be conditional on finding a version 10 sdk, but the find_winsdk would actually succeed if you don\u0027t have a version 10 but a version 8.* sdk and then SOLARINC has \"-I\" added?",

      "message": "Nope, it\u0027s not. UCRT@MSVC14.0 (Universal C Runtime) location is conditional on compiler version, not SDK version. I tried to be extra verbose in the commit message and explain this split:\n\n  Previously, all of the CRT headers, sources, and libraries were\n  distributed as part of the Visual C++ SDK, installed in the VC\n  subdirectory of Visual Studio installation (generally C:\\Program\n  Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\\VC). The files for the\n  VCRuntime are still part of the Visual C++ SDK. The headers, sources,\n  and libraries are now distributed as part of a separate Universal CRT\n  SDK. This SDK is included with Visual Studio; it is installed to\n  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10.\n\nStill it may be better to create dedicated method: find_ucrt() or some such and use it here and not vanilla find_winsdk. Note that ii haven\u0027t tested this change against other SDKs version as 10.",
