      "message": "Hi, \n\n- The file contains a section break [continuous].\n- In this condition, the \u0027( SFX_ITEM_ON !\u003d pSet-\u003eGetItemState(RES_PAGEDESC, true, \u0026pI)\u0027 turns out as false.\n- As far as I can understand, itmeans that the RES_PAGEDESC is set ON\n_ so there is a section break, but can\u0027t identify which one .. continuous OR next\n- Is there any flag which can indicate that this PAGEDESC is a section break [continuous]\n- Kindly suggest. Thanks :)",

RES_CNTNT is \"content\", as in e.g. content of a TextFrame, so it specifies an anchor position.",
