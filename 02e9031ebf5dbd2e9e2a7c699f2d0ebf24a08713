      "message": "Hi, \n\n- The file contains a section break [continuous].\n- In this condition, the \u0027( SFX_ITEM_ON !\u003d pSet-\u003eGetItemState(RES_PAGEDESC, true, \u0026pI)\u0027 turns out as false.\n- As far as I can understand, itmeans that the RES_PAGEDESC is set ON\n_ so there is a section break, but can\u0027t identify which one .. continuous OR next\n- Is there any flag which can indicate that this PAGEDESC is a section break [continuous]\n- Kindly suggest. Thanks :)",

RES_CNTNT is \"content\", as in e.g. content of a TextFrame, so it specifies an anchor position.",

      "message": "Hi,\n- In order to understand the behavior of the section break [continuous] I debugged a sample file with a continuous section break.\n- In this case this condition http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/sw/source/filter/ww8/wrtw8nds.cxx#2742 is satisfied.\n- GetItemState() returns SFX_ITEM_DEFAULT\n- I debugged GetItemState() for the issue file, http://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/svl/source/items/itemset.cxx#467 the condition fails.\n- For the issue file, it seems that it is able to find some object in \u0027ppFnd\u0027 and thus it does not returns SFX_ITEM_DEFAULT\n- Please can you give me some hint here ?\n- Thanks :)",
