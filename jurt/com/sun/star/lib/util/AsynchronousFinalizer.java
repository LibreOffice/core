/**
 * Helper class to asynchronously execute finalize methods.
 *
 * <p>Current JVMs seem not to be robust against long-running finalize methods,
 * in that such long-running finalize methods may lead to OutOfMemoryErrors.
 * This class mitigates the problem by asynchronously shifting the bodies of
 * potentially long-running finalize methods into an extra thread.  Classes that
 * make use of this in their finalize methods are the proxies used in the
 * intra-process JNI UNO bridge and the inter-process Java URP UNO bridge (where
 * in both cases finalizers lead to synchronous UNO release calls).</p>
 *
 * <p>Irrespective whether JVMs are getting more mature and should no longer
 * have problems with long-running finalize methods, at least the JNI UNO bridge
 * needs some way to stop finalization of proxies (to C++ objects) well before
 * process exit, as provided by drain().</p>
