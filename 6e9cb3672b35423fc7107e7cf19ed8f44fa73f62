      "message": "So now a bunch of other states for text color were added, if I change the text color it will change for macOS backend, but what if I change the text color for other backends? This also needs to be handeled IMHO - if not in any other way then to set the text color to the same one for all states.",

      "message": "Bunch of text colors was added for maximum flexibility. As changing text colors here in macOS specific code, these color changes do not interfere with other backends. Changes of text color for other backends can be done independenty in appropriate backend specific code if required.\n\nInitalizing all text colors was not done within the previous implementation. A complete initalization of all text colors should not be an issue, but scope of this change would be extended.",
