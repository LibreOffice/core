      "message": "So now a bunch of other states for text color were added, if I change the text color it will change for macOS backend, but what if I change the text color for other backends? This also needs to be handeled IMHO - if not in any other way then to set the text color to the same one for all states.",

      "message": "Bunch of text colors was added for maximum flexibility. As changing text colors here in macOS specific code, these color changes do not interfere with other backends. Changes of text color for other backends can be done independenty in appropriate backend specific code if required.\n\nInitalizing all text colors was not done within the previous implementation. A complete initalization of all text colors should not be an issue, but scope of this change would be extended.",

      "message": "What I mean is this:\n\nFor example you have only Color maTextColor, which would set the text color for all states. Now you added maPressedTextColor, which is set to some default value (black) for all backends, but you only set this to a different color for OSX. In button.cxx however you add the pressed state for all backends. Now imagine I change in windows backend the maTextColor to white - that wouldn\u0027t set the maPressedTextColor to white, right? \n\nSo in Windows the text color would be white, but when you press the button, it would turn black because you didn\u0027t set it to another color, but before the change it would be white for all states.\n\nDo you see what I mean?",

      "message": "Yes I see. This will be the case if an arbitrary new color is defined. I have choosen this approach, because there have been additional colors for button status definined already (maButtonTextColor, maDefaultActionButtonTextColor, maActionButtonTextColor, maActionButtonRolloverTextColor), but not all possible status have been covered. So, possible button status are covered completely now and macOS requirements are able to be satisfied too. If anyone wants to change button text colors for another backend, the different existing colors have to be adjusted and the new colors as well.\n\nAn alternative implementation would alter the class hierarchy because for drawing text there is no information what the text is about inside the backends. So it is not possible to distinguish wheter text to be drawn belongs to a button or to something else. A change of class hierarchy, but only a little change, is required to cover text drawing within non key windows on macOS. This is not covered by this change to prevent too large changes as possible.\n\nTo sum up: Pro for the choosen implementation is getting the colors for all possible button states completely defined now while allowing the backends to handle them differently.",
