      "message": "Bah, my bad. So this could work as intended, but in ScConditionEntry::UpdateReference() for URM_MOVE the old position is also passed as new position to ScTokenArray::AdjustReferenceOnMove(...,rOldPos,rNewPos) so effectively nothing is changed if the reference points outside the moved range.\n\nProbably ScConditionEntry::UpdateReference() in this case needs to calculate the old position also for URM_MOVE, similar to what it does for URM_INSDEL.\n\nThat looks suspicious to me anyway, because the same effect kicks in when cut\u0026paste a cell with conditional format, so the conditional formula does not point to the original cells anymore. But I didn\u0027t check implications it would have when generally changing that. Might be that then is also wrong if a cell is cut from an existing range and the range is not split into several conditional formats.\n\nSo maybe best introduce an optional parameter to ScConditionEntry::UpdateReference() to handle this specific case here.",
