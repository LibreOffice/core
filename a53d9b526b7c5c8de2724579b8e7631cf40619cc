      "message": "That\u0027s interesting, and explains a few puzzling things. However, that truth does not seem to be roundtrip-able - at least not for named ranges. The absolute, but unflagged3D HTML_1 named range becomes relative when reopening the .ods file.\n\nSo I think your -1 is not for the code change, but for the terminology used in the commit message.\n\n(And that begs the question: if initRange defaults to AbsTab, then should it also default to Flag3D - which would also have fixed this problem? I guess that requires investigation on how export/import handles that in other situations. Obviously that would be a much bigger impact change. My expectation is that unflagged AbsTabs will become relative in most cases during a round-trip. Unfortunately I don\u0027t know calc well enough to plan what other round-trip situations to test...)",
