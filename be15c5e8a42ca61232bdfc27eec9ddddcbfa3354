OBJ_CCUT] to OBJ_CIRC \u0026 bools in SdrCircObj\nSame for [OBJ_POLY..OBJ_SPLNFILL, plus OBJ_PATHPOLY..OBJ_PATHPLIN].\nSame for [OBJ_TEXT..OBJ_OUTLINETEXT].\nRest was done with RTTI, as soon as you just have one ID per SdrObject type.\nMost of the IDs e.g. for circle just decide filled/non-filled with same geometry.",
