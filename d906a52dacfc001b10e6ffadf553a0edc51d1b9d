      "message": "Patchset 2 placement of SwWrtShell::Edit function in the SwEditWin::GetFocus function causes unit test failure for most likely good reason, although I can not explain why, but can repro the failure locally by doing SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN\u003dsvp make CppunitTest_desktop_lib. Patchset 5 places the Edit function in the annotate shell destructor SwAnnotationShell::~SwAnnotationShell. This is taken from what is done in the draw base shell destructor SwDrawBaseShell::~SwDrawBaseShell(). Perhaps this is the best placement as of yet.  \n",
