      "message": "Oops, I wanted to respond that the ImplIsLowSurrogate(nChar) check could never have been true anyway, if you look at the preceding code (so I had replaced it with the assert).  But if you /do/ actually look at the preceding code close enough (which I apparently hadn\u0027t done), you notice that lone low surrogates do fall through it to here.  So this needs some fixing (in all the sal/textenc/convert*.cxx files covered by this change).  Thanks for spotting!",
