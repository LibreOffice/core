      "message": "\u003e the cppunit test CppunitTest_sc_a11y failed ( https://ci.libreoffice.org/job/gerrit_windows/131554/ )\n\nOK that\u0027s pretty weird to me, somehow in the Windows case, not only the shortcuts are part of the accessible name, but it\u0027s also in German somehow -- although test/user-template/registry-common/modifications.xcd seemingly should force the locale to en-US.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what to do here… for me it\u0027s inconsistent the results are that different on Windows for *the internal* a11y API.  I\u0027m also not very familiar with Windows, but it seems odd to me to present the shortcut this way to a11y -- and again, it should either be universal or done at the platform layer, not in the internal API… or is it something with how tests are run?  Unfortunately I don\u0027t have access to a Windows machine to play with it more though.\n\nIf it\u0027s something that seem reasonable to others though, I could adjust the code to ignore something like tab or a set of spaces followed by a shortcut (but a shortcut is not trivial to recognize, let alone in all locales) or maybe just anything after 2+ spaces or a tab or something.\nAnybody has any insight/opinion here?",

(Maybe appending what get_accKeyboardShortcut() returns to the string currently returned in getAccName() in winaccessibility\\source\\UAccCOM\\MAccessible.cxx - based on the role? - would do that, but would probably need a closer look whether it does and whether it\u0027s desirable in the first place).",
