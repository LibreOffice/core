BTW, the process of adding more kinds of barcodes wouldn\u0027t be a lot of work as it would only require adding the type(barcode type) to the method \"GetBarCodeType\" and assigning a particular integer to the type (for eg. 1 \u003d QR Code, 2 \u003d Code 128, etc.), would this serve as a solution or is there something I\u0027m missing?",
