      "message": "True means that groups are completely ignored at this level. I think you might want to clarify that in the comments, because when this is set, RadioButton can have no concept of the group value, and only a code-read will tell you that.\n\nI\u0027m afraid that it might lead to complications where a button is \"checked\" at this level, and then at a higher level it might miss the fact that it needs to uncheck the other group members\u0027 value. Using bUsesExplicitGroup almost effectively makes this a read-only layer in terms of functionality (that is a complete guess on my part). Or that some kind of initialization depended on the umpteen gazillion times that initializations are performed on this level.\n\nThis is a BOLD move. I hope it works. :-)",
