      "message": "non-NULL gr_face means that creating a graphite face object succeeded, which means that shaping will go through graphite. If the Silf table is there but bad for example, NULL will be returned and so the code will continue with shaping with OT/dumb and script breaking will occur.\n\nhb_font_get_face() ensures that the font is initialised in harfbuzz when it is called. I.e. it doesn\u0027t return NULL. (See LogicalFontInstance::InitHbFont).",
