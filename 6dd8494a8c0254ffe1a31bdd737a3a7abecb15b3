      "message": "That\u0027s actually what I had in mind first.\nHowever, this wouldn\u0027t match what is actually done during the tar archive creation, since fakeroot is only used for Linux and Solaris there right now,\ns. solenv/bin/modules/installer/download.pm (line 708ff) and solenv/bin/modules/installer/simplepackage.pm (line 443ff).\n\nHonestly, I\u0027m not sure know why it states \"only required for Solaris and Linux\", but I left that unchanged from the previous version where libgetuid was used.\n\nIf it\u0027s needed for other Unix systems as well, that should possibly be extended, but I\u0027d rather see this as a separate change, since it changes the semantics.\n\n(See also function \u0027setglobalvariables()\u0027 in solenv/bin/modules/installer/parameter.pm, where the mapping for package formats is done based on the operating system as well.)",
