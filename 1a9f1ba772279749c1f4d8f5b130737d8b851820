I\u0027ve solved the merge conflicts to speed up the merge.\n\nNote: This patch doesn\u0027t handle transparency issues, and the buggy outline handling of LO (e.g. 1% font color (line) transparency results 100% fill transparency of the outline text). Likely a good idea to keep the original outline fill color and transparencies by grab-bagging them (issue 1) before implementing MSO-like font outlines (issue 2). See the test document and screenshots about the remaining problems attached to the bug report. I suggest to file new bug reports for issue 1 and issue 2.",
