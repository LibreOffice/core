      "message": "the argument is valid and makes complete sense. The problem was only in the case of undoing. sometimes charts won\u0027t disappear on undoing if it was created using copy-paste. I may be missing something but it was not disappearing because maObjectRange was not correctly initialised and InvalidatePartOfView was never called.",
