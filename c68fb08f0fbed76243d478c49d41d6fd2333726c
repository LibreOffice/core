      "message": "Stephan: I am not sure if you mean a particular case, or the whole idea in general...\n\nIf the latter - I think \"harmful\" is a bit of an exaggeration ;-)  The idea was that even though technically, the compiler knows the return value, and thus the \"auto\" is perfectly fine, the human does not, and while debugging, I often ended up searching each and every such a case in the header files.\n\nThat means - for me, it would be enough to warn / rewrite only those cases when auto is used for a return value of a function; but not for iteration or constructing.\n\nHaving said that, these days I feel I should probably rather switch to an IDE that can show me such info with just pointing the mouse; I\u0027ve switched for a couple of other languages, and never look back, hopefully VS CODE (or something) can do this for C++ \u0026 survives the LibreOffice size?",
