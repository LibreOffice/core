But in case we can improve e.g. framework/source/dispatch/dispatchdisabler.cxx in the future to be more efficient and we can somehow make sure that nobody disables commands by returning empty dispatch references, I have no problem with dropping this. I hope that\u0027s an acceptable compromise. :-)",
