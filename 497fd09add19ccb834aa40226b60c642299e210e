      "message": "It seems that everywhere this ctor is called, a new unique_ptr is created. So maybe it makes sense to pass a pointer to the format instead of unique_ptr to frame client, and construct the unique_ptr in place, this way eliding a creation and destruction of a temporary unique_ptr?",
