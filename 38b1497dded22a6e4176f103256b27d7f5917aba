E.g., here you removed whitespaces in the function definition that is otherwise unchanged. The unrelated formatting edits make reviewing difficult.\n\nIf you intend to re-format something, please use a separate dedicated commit for that.\n\nThe lines that you should change back are (numbered by new version):\n\n30-32; 47; 49; 60-61; 92; 102-104; 108; 112; 126; ... I hope you get the idea.\n\nSame for the hxx.",
