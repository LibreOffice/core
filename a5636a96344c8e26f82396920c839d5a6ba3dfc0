I think we need it back.\n\nWrt. holding the solar-mutex: Application::Yield releases the mutex when there is nothing to do itself.\n\nEach of the threads themselves also use the SolarMutex - except for the most intense inner-loop which does the heavy-duty cell storage collection stuff. The reason being that making anything more than that of the import filter thread-safe is a nightmare - even making this smaller piece thread-safe is rather non-trivial.",
