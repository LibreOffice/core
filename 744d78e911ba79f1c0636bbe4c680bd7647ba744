      "message": "I tried your patch WITHOUT reverting my stuff. I didn\u0027t get a unit test failure, and visually I see two comments - the same as before.\n\nYour patch WITH reverting my stuff breaks the document (but not the unit test). The unit test itself was rendered ineffective by changing it to a CPPUNIT_TEST_FIXTURE. (I made a note of that to Miklos.) It breaks when I change it back to a DECLARE_OOXMLEXPORT_TEST.\n\nSo I\u0027m really wondering how you hit on my unit test.\nP.S. I have no problem with my patch being reverted and the bug being re-opened if you know that my hacking is just wrong.",
