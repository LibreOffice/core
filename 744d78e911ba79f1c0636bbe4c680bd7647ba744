      "message": "I tried your patch WITHOUT reverting my stuff. I didn\u0027t get a unit test failure, and visually I see two comments - the same as before.\n\nYour patch WITH reverting my stuff breaks the document (but not the unit test). The unit test itself was rendered ineffective by changing it to a CPPUNIT_TEST_FIXTURE. (I made a note of that to Miklos.) It breaks when I change it back to a DECLARE_OOXMLEXPORT_TEST.\n\nSo I\u0027m really wondering how you hit on my unit test.\nP.S. I have no problem with my patch being reverted and the bug being re-opened if you know that my hacking is just wrong.",

Prior to my fix, on the first RT it duplicated the comment, and on the second round-trip, it corrupted the document.\n\nAfter my fix, the comment moved anchor point on the first RT, and was lost on the second RT.\n\nWith your fix, it is lost on the first RT.\n\nPerhaps the best thing to do is to keep my commit, and just remove that part of the ooxmlexport5 test. Otherwise, we will have to remove the ooxmlexport16 test [which will break when Miklos changes the loadAndSave() to loadAndReload()].",
