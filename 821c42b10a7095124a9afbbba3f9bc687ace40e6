With your change, it is true till the end of the paragraph, so it\u0027s no longer possible to know if we\u0027re indeed inside a drawing.\n\nPlease add a separate:\n\nbool m_bHadDrawing; ///\u003c Had drawing in this paragraph.\n\nif you really need that state, so it\u0027s clear that it\u0027s true till the end of the paragraph.",
