      "message": "tricky.. this can\u0027t go before CONV_LAST because it is not a real address convention, there\u0027s ScCompiler::pConvention array of ScCompiler::Conventions instance pointers which are looped over at some places, but CONV_LEGACY should not be such instance. This must go after CONV_LAST instead, and best comment why and what exactly it is used for, i.e. only for INDIRECT(). Maybe also name CONV_LEGACY to something more telling, like CONV_A1_XLA1.",
