How to write my own sdbc driver

all example files can be found in connectivity/workben/skeleton

Pre implementation steps
- copy all files from connectivity/workben/skeleton into your new created directory under
  connectivity/source/drivers and rename the first char of the files to one which isn't used so far
  ( please have a look at the other drivers )
- search all occurrences of skeleton and replace them to a name which you prefer

1. Implement a class called driver or modify the existing skeleton	-> have a look at SDriver.?xx 
2. Implement a class called connection								-> have a look at SConnection.?xx 	
3. Have a look at the DatabaseMetaData								-> see SDatabaseMetaData.cxx
	The methods which should be implemented at least are
		- getTableTypes
		- getTables
		- getTypeInfo
		- getColumns

4. You need a statement to show/access some data					-> have a look at SStatement.cxx
																	-> especially executeQuery()

5. The ResultSet: without you see nothing							-> look at SResultSet.cxx
6. The ResultSetMetaData needed to get some information about what are waiting for us
																	-> look at SResultSetMetaData.cxx

7. The prepared statement is the last class we have to implement now
	-> you have to allow statements like "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?"


8. insert entry in version.mk
# ----------------------------SKELETON settings-----------------------------------#
# target
SKELETON_TARGET=skeleton

# the major 
SKELETON_MAJOR=2
# the minor 
SKELETON_MINOR=0
# the micro 
SKELETON_MICRO=0

# this is a c++ compatible library 
SKELETON_CPP=1

SKELETON=$(SKELETON_TARGET_TARGET)_$(CMPEXT)


9. copy dll to program dir of office and register the dll

10. congratulations you have now implement your own driver :-)
