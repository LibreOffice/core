xcu files are made from several sections, the main ones are: Properties and Features

Property: actual setting with its underlying type and its default value

Feature: a boolean that says "let the user change that setting in the Advanced Settings UI"

This is checked by using officecfg/registry/schema/org/openoffice/Office/DataAccess/Drivers.xcs
and configmgr mechanism
There are two kinds of properties named "Value":
- first one is in "Property" groups and has a static oor:type="any" (can take on boolean, int and other types of values)
- second one is in "Feature" groups and has a static oor:type="boolean" so can take on only boolean values.

Each node in Feature section must have an equivalent in Property section
Most of the time the node name of both sections should be equal,
however there are 5 known exceptions (more?):
- "UseBracketedOuterJoinSyntax" feature => "EnableOuterJoinEscape" property
- "UseDOSLineEnds" feature => "PreferDosLikeLineEnds" property
- "UseSQL92NamingConstraints" feature => "EnableSQL92Check" property
- "AppendTableAliasInSelect" feature => "AppendTableAliasName" property
- "UseKeywordAsBeforeAlias" feature => "GenerateASBeforeCorrelationName"

See dbaccess/source/ui/dlg/DbAdminImpl.cxx, ODbDataSourceAdministrationHelper constructor, eg:
m_aIndirectPropTranslator.emplace( <ID>, <property> )
and dbaccess/source/ui/misc/dsmeta.cxx, lcl_getFeatureMappings() function, eg:
{ <ID>, <feature> }
