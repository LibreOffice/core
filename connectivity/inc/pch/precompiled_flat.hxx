 This file has been autogenerated by update_pch.sh. It is possible to edit it
 manually (such as when an include file has been moved/renamed/removed). All such
 manual changes will be rewritten by the next run of update_pch.sh (which presumably
 also fixes all possible problems, so it's usually better to use it).

 Generated on 2016-02-14 21:30:25 using:
 ./bin/update_pch connectivity flat --cutoff=4 --exclude:system --exclude:module --include:local

 If after updating build fails, use the following command to locate conflicting headers:
 ./bin/update_pch_bisect ./connectivity/inc/pch/precompiled_flat.hxx "make connectivity.build" --find-conflicts
