<!-- Recent Java 6 VMs make calls to JNI Attach/DetachCurrentThread (which this
     code does extensively) very expensive.  A follow-up JVM fix reduced the
     overhead significantly again for all threads but the main thread.  So a
     quick hack to improve performance of this component again is to confine it
     in the affine apartment (where all code will run on a single, dedicated
     thread that is guaranteed no to be the main thread).  However, a better fix
     would still be to redesign the code so that it does not call
     Attach/DetachCurrentThread so frequently:

  <implementation name="com.sun.star.comp.sdbc.JDBCDriver">
    <service name="com.sun.star.sdbc.Driver"/>
  </implementation>
