/*  Note:
    The resource file built here (hsqldb.res, finally) is *not* included
    in the final OOo installation. Instead, it is only built to ensure that
    the two images below are included in the application-wide image repository
    (images.zip). This way, they can be accessed at runtime, but without the
    indirection via a resource file - the GraphicProvider service supports
    a "private:imagerepository/*" protocol meanwhile, which allows this.

    If there were another possibility to ensure that the images are
    put into the repository, instead of creating a resource file for them,
    then we would use this other way ...
