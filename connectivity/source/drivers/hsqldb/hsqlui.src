// Note:
// The resource file built here (hsqldb.res, finally) is *not* included
// in the final OOo installation. Instead, it is only built to ensure that
// the image below is included in the application-wide image repository
// (images.zip). This way, they can be accessed at runtime, but without the
// indirection via a resource file - the GraphicProvider service supports
// a "private:imagerepository/*" protocol meanwhile, which allows this.
//
// If there were another possibility to ensure that the images are
// put into the repository, instead of creating a resource file for them,
// then we would use this other way ...
