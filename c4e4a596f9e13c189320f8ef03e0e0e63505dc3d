      "message": "I have (obviously?) additional patches based on this, not yet posted. Initial patches had other stuff in it, like \"width / height \u003e 0\" and unifying restoring a window from maximized state. I really hope I correctly split them and (also obviously) I can\u0027t test them on all archs. This also interferes with  https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/135082, so I really want to get this right as refactoring only, just in case 135082 needs a revert for some unforeseen problems, but this patch stays (much larger).",
