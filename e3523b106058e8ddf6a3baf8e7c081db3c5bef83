      "message": "After a detailed look, I found no missing Updates in other functions. \n\nBUT what I found out: The filling of the 4 (to be) patterned objects (right bar and the most right squares in the key) is a GDI_COMMENT and thus an EMF+ Action, which is not handled here, but in cpp_canvas module. When I disable the PassEMFPlus(...) function, the output is fine (ok, besides no patterns at all). \n\nThese EMF+ Actions contains four \"EmfPlusFillRects\" records, where the UpdateFillStyle() has to be placed, but since this is a complete different module, it is not possible \n\nnow I don\u0027t know how to continue.",
