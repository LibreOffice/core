      "message": "Received from Alex by email :\n\"\nFrom my perspective, this is a good thing. It has always annoyed me that these tables were visible in the schema tree to every user of an ODB, even if they were read protected.\n\nI suppose there might be the odd case where a DBA might want to be able to call up / manipulate these objects from within the LO UI, but it seems unlikely when there are other UIs for that, or the command line. \n\nAs far as I\u0027m concerned, this seems to be a good idea, with the added bonus of it making it look and behave like the JDBC connector.\"",
