      "message": "I think I understand what is happening here. We have to map Writer-specific Which (here RES_CHRATR_BACKGROUND) via a common SID to an EE-specific Which (EE_CHAR_BKGCOLOR).\nHowever, one is a SvxBrushItem and the other is a SvxColorItem, so they can\u0027t directly map - and thus have different SIDs. EE-SID_ATTR_CHAR_BACK_COLOR and SW-SID_ATTR_CHAR_COLOR_BACKGROUND (I think).\n\nPerhaps there is some central place where these conversions are supposed to happen but I haven\u0027t found such a place. This here in the import code is safe anyway - even if not elegant/magical.",

      "message": "sw/source/core/bastyp/init.cxx has a slot table that knows how to map between e.g. SID_ATTR_CHAR_WEIGHT and RES_CHRATR_WEIGHT. editeng/source/editeng/editdoc.cxx has a similar mapping between SID_ATTR_CHAR_WEIGHT and EE_CHAR_WEIGHT. This mechanism is used to iterate the content of comment, shape or other editeng-powered text in the WW8 export, which only has handlers for sw/ which ids.\n\nPerhaps you could clean up this patch by filling in the 0 entry for RES_CHRATR_HIGHLIGHT in sw/source/core/bastyp/init.cxx?",

      "message": "OK - good. I\u0027m understanding correctly.\n\nIn your example, both share the same SID. In this case the attribute doesn\u0027t share the same SID (because of a different underlying SvxItem).\nEE_CHAR_BKGCOLOR is SID_ATTR_CHAR_BACK_COLOR.\nRES_CHRATR_BACKGROUND is SID_ATTR_BRUSH_CHAR.\n\nSure, HIGHLIGHT could be mapped as well to SID_ATTR_BRUSH_CHAR - I didn\u0027t see any existing unique SID associated with highlights.\n\nI tried the opposite (setting the slots to zero) and that passed a make check.\n\nSince the mappings are left hanging, and since HIGHLIGHT is actually something different from SID_ATTR_BRUSH_CHAR (it is emulation more than a mapping) it is probably better to leave it \"slotless\".",
