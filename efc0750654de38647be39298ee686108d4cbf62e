      "message": "I think I understand what is happening here. We have to map Writer-specific Which (here RES_CHRATR_BACKGROUND) via a common SID to an EE-specific Which (EE_CHAR_BKGCOLOR).\nHowever, one is a SvxBrushItem and the other is a SvxColorItem, so they can\u0027t directly map - and thus have different SIDs. EE-SID_ATTR_CHAR_BACK_COLOR and SW-SID_ATTR_CHAR_COLOR_BACKGROUND (I think).\n\nPerhaps there is some central place where these conversions are supposed to happen but I haven\u0027t found such a place. This here in the import code is safe anyway - even if not elegant/magical.",

      "message": "sw/source/core/bastyp/init.cxx has a slot table that knows how to map between e.g. SID_ATTR_CHAR_WEIGHT and RES_CHRATR_WEIGHT. editeng/source/editeng/editdoc.cxx has a similar mapping between SID_ATTR_CHAR_WEIGHT and EE_CHAR_WEIGHT. This mechanism is used to iterate the content of comment, shape or other editeng-powered text in the WW8 export, which only has handlers for sw/ which ids.\n\nPerhaps you could clean up this patch by filling in the 0 entry for RES_CHRATR_HIGHLIGHT in sw/source/core/bastyp/init.cxx?",
