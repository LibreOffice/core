      "message": "I think I understand what is happening here. We have to map Writer-specific Which (here RES_CHRATR_BACKGROUND) via a common SID to an EE-specific Which (EE_CHAR_BKGCOLOR).\nHowever, one is a SvxBrushItem and the other is a SvxColorItem, so they can\u0027t directly map - and thus have different SIDs. EE-SID_ATTR_CHAR_BACK_COLOR and SW-SID_ATTR_CHAR_COLOR_BACKGROUND (I think).\n\nPerhaps there is some central place where these conversions are supposed to happen but I haven\u0027t found such a place. This here in the import code is safe anyway - even if not elegant/magical.",
