      "message": "i think this could be a good idea independent of removing the call in disposing() as it is not so useful for a listener to receive an event and not know from where.\n\n(but it could be in a separate commit too, not necessary to do it in this one.)\n\n(in a multi-threaded scenario it could happen that one thread calls disposing() and another calls simultaneously something else on this class that calls this function)",
