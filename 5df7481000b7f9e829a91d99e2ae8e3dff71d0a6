Making this particular phrase ALWAYS false also works and doesn\u0027t cause any unit test failures. The code exists from the creation of *OpenOffice* IsColBreak() in flowfrm.cxx.\n\nSo, I\u0027m open to any advice on which choice is better since I have no idea what the original purpose was, and no idea which option is best.",
