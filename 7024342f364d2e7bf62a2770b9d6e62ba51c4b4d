Then I fixed my omission, and described that after the return, the \u0027else\u0027 should be flattened - otherwise, the return is useless itself. I meant that the return is *needed*, and *after it*, you should flatten the \u0027else\u0027 part.\n\nNow you flattened the \u0027else\u0027, but you dropped the return - making it wrong.",
