(for backwards compatibility, we could either assume that the existing \"winreg:\" would only ever have occurred in LO\u0027s own fundamental ini-file, and would now be replaced by \"winreg:current_machine\" there, or else that an empty \"uri\" part would be treated the same as \"current_machine\")",
