Generators for language-binding--specific representations of UNOIDL entities:
- cppumaker generates header (.hdl and .hpp) files for the C++ UNO language
  binding
- javamaker generates class files for the JVM language binding
- the codemaker for .Net is in module cli_ure

Some of the code is re-used by the skeletonmakers in module unodevtools.


Note the different terminology used by cppumaker vs. gbuild for the three
variants that can be generated by cppumaker for some of the inline functions:

  cppumaker switch: -L;    cpputype.cxx: light;          gbuild: normal;
  cppumaker switch: none;  cpputype.cxx: normal;         gbuild: bootstrap;
  cppumaker switch: -C;    cpputype.cxx: comprehensive;  gbuild: comprehensive;

...a recipe for confusion.
