      "message": "hmmm do i understand it right that there is one PO file per language for the merge target?\n\nin that case the \"firstword\" here is a problem: this really needs to depend on all PO files, not just one, i.e. you want a foreach (which may be inside the wildcard, according to documentation wildcard takes multiple parameters)",
