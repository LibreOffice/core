      "message": "The original description is the same as for the IFS function, but the functions differ:\n- IFS tests if condition (testN) is TRUE, then resultN is returned,\n- SWITCH tests if condition (valueN) \u003d\u003d expression is TRUE, then resultN is returned.\n\nThe patch should correct that both functions have the same meaning; of course we can use better wording than I suggested (based on the IFS description it could be \"Checks 1 or more values and returns a result corresponding to the first value equal to the given expression.\" as well).",
