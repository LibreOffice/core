      "message": "You had been very careful to keep the existing formatting of the code, and didn\u0027t introduce unrelated noise like removal/addition of spaces/newlines, etc. This is the only single place that had this - likely an overlook.\n\nThis my nitpick is to encourage you to keep up the great work of changing exactly what should be changed in the commit 😊 so that the following commits have even less such things 👍🏻",
