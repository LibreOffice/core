      "message": "This check used to test if there were 5 characters read (\"\u003c?xml\"). Now it tests if exactly 200 chars read, thus filtering out any file \u003c200 bytes long. I suppose it\u0027s better to test for \u003e\u003d6 \"\u003cmath\u003e\" or so",

      "message": "Well, yes, a MathML document with less than 200 characters would be quite odd, but maybe some small fragment would fit into that. 6 is a tad too small limit though, it should be at least \"\u003cmath\u003e\u003c/math\u003e\" for an empty MathML document ;-)   so 13. Actually 7 for \"\u003cmath/\u003e\" would also be possible but then the \"\u003cmath/\u003e\" would have to be tested as well, I\u0027m pretty sure we can neglect that..",
