07/07/2004 (SB): BugID=i29741
  Reference registries for the OOo 2.0 branch copied from the OOo 1.1 branch:
    OO_20/types.rdb <- OO_11/types.rdb 1.6
    OO_20/types_doc.rdb <- OO_11/types_doc.rdb 1.8
  Changed accumulation-based services to single-interface--based ones
  (types_doc.rdb only):
    com.sun.star.bridge.UnoUrlResolver
    com.sun.star.connection.Acceptor
    com.sun.star.connection.Connector

07/08/2004 (SB): BugID=i29741
  Changed accumulation-based services to single-interface--based ones
  (types_doc.rdb only):
    com.sun.star.sdb.InteractionHandler
    com.sun.star.sdbc.ConnectionPool

07/12/2004 (SB): BugID=i29741
  Resync'ed OO_20/types_doc.rdb <- OO_11/types_doc.rdb 1.10 (plus all
  modifications listed above)

08/18/2004 (JSC/JL): BugID=i31702
  remove needs entry in com.sun.star.system.SimpleCommandMail because needs is
  deprecated and it caused an assertion in the cli_ure project while generating
  the cli interfaces from type library.

11/19/2004 (JSC/TL): BugID=i36687
  adjust ChainedTextFrame service. Remove XChainable interface and insert properties.
  Interface was never implemented and the functionality was supported by properties.

01/20/2005 (JSC): BugID=i40985
  change const value com.sun.star.configuration.backend.NodeAttribute:MASK to
  0x7F00 instead of 0xFF00. Necessary because of a bug fix in idlc and possible
  because only 3 bits are masked.

02/18/05 (JSC/TL): BugID=i42890
  change ForBiddenCharacters property of com.sun.star.document.Settings
  -> remove the readonly flag, it should never have been readonly.

05/10/05 (JSC/TL): BugID=i43697
  we removed the duplicated reference to XEnumerationAccess.

08/26/05 (JSC): TaskID=i53814
  I've exchanged the current type library to the type library of OO2.0 (build m125)
  for all further compatibility type checks.

10/21/05 (JSC): TaskID=i56329
  Correct com.sun.star.sdb.OfficeDatabaseDocument, it supports one more interface
  and it is not published -> compatible change.
  Correct com.sun.star.text.XEnumerationAccess, remove duplicate interface from
  published service. Also a compatible change.
  Probably the regcompare tools needs to be improved

10/26/05 (JSC): TaskID=i25406, i25472, i50417
  ..style.CharacterPropertiesAsian -> remove 3 wrong paragraph properties
  ..style.PageProperties -> for 93 properties related to footer and header
  the attribute maybevoid was inserted
  ..text.textfield.DateTime -> NumberFormat changed from short to long
  to ensure that the same format is used in all applications

01/25/06 (JSC): TaskID=i611389
  change the compatibility test to use always the type library in the type_reference
  directory. We need only one reference per source stand. I have also removed the
  types_doc.rdb because all type info is already in the normal types.rdb, even
  the service nad singleton type info.
  In the same step I have updated the reference type library with the rdb of
  OOo2.0.1 and have patched the following singleton types to ensure that we need
  only one type library:
    - com.sun.star.script.browse.theBrowseNodeFactory
    - com.sun.star.script.provider.theMasterScriptProviderFactory
    - com.sun.star.util.theMacroExpander
    - com.sun.star.util.theOfficeInstallationDirectories

01/25/06 (JSC): TaskID=i49101
  adapt com.sun.star.text.GenericTextDocument service. Insert support of
  com.sun.star.lang.XMultiServiceFactory because this interface was missing but
  is substantial for text documents and was implemented from the beginning.

03/15/06 (JSC): TaskID=i63172
  update the reference type library with the released version of OOo2.0.2
  (OOB680m5). This type library doesn't contain the already inserted singletons:
    - com.sun.star.script.browse.theBrowseNodeFactory
    - com.sun.star.script.provider.theMasterScriptProviderFactory
    - com.sun.star.util.theOfficeInstallationDirectories
  This of course is accepted to have a 1:1 relation between the reference and
  OOo2.0.2. With the next update we get in sync and depending versioning processes
  won't be affected.

05/15/06 (JSC, TL): TaskID=i54823,i62825
  adapt the documentation because of specification errors which have never matched
  the existing implmentation.
  Style -> FollowStyle property is now of type string instead of boolean
  TextTableRow -> TableColumnSeparators is now a sequence instead of the single return

05/31/06 (TL, JSC)): TaskID i50628
   Exchange property UserDefinedAttributes with service UserDefinedAttributesSupplier
   including this property to provide a unique description at a single place for
   the property.

07/19/06 (JSC): TaskID=i67534
  update reference type library with the released version of OOo2.0.3. The
  new reference type library is taken from the release source tree OOC680m7.
  The last two changes of TL are integrated in the type library as well, at least
  the conflicting files:
  com/sun/star/style/Style.idl
  com/sun/star/text/CellProperties.idl
  com/sun/star/text/TextTableRow.idl

10/25/06 (JSC): TaskID=i70808
  update reference type library with the released version of OOo2.0.4. The
  new reference type library is taken from the release source tree OOD680m5.

04/03/07 (JSC): TaskID=i76046
  update reference type library with the rleased version of OO0.2.2.0. The new
  reference type library is taken from the release source tree OOF680 m14.

06/13/07 (MBA): TaskID=i26672
  removed deprecated and unsupported properties; added long supported but
  never documented properties.

09/26/07 (JSC): TaskID=i80473
  update reference type library with the rleased version of OO.org 2.3. The new
  reference type library is taken from the release source tree OOG680 m5.

03/17/08 (TL, JSC): TaskID=i85576
  remove two never implemented properties 'TopMargin' and 'ButtomMargin' from
  com.sun.star.text.CellRange. 
  
06/26/08 (TL, JSC): TaskID=i86515
  change css.text.IllustrationIndex into css.text.IllustrationsIndex because the 
  implementation used the plural version.

07/23/08 (TL, JSC): TaskID=i48676
  change return type of css.linguistic2.XDictionary:getcount from short to long 
  to support bigger user dictionaries.
  
04/12/08 (JSC): TaskID=i96902
  update reference rdb with the released version from OO.org 3.0 (ooo300m9)
  
04/17/09 (tl, JSC): TaskID=i96846
  changed old and not longer used properties in css.linguistic2.LinguProperties
  to maybevoid and deprecate. They should be removed in a future version. The 
  implementation will never return them.
  
02/25/09 (MST, JSC): TaskID=i96209
  rename module css.text.FieldMaster to css.text.fieldmaster.
  the implementation handles both variants.

05/15/09 (MST, JSC): TaskID=i101965
  fix read-only status of properties of css.text.TextPortion

02/12/10 (JSC): TaskID=i107712, i107695

  RedLineDataTime have to be RedlineDateTime.
  Update reference type library with the version of OOo 3.2. The new
  reference type library is taken from the release source tree OOO320 m12.

02/06/10 (JSC): TaskID=i112019
  Update reference type library with the version of OOo 3.2.1. The new
  reference type library is taken from the release source tree OOO320 m19.

11/09/10 (JSC): TaskID=i114887
  remove drafts module from reference rdb. The odl drafts type are not used 
  and i cleaned up the module and the type library.

01/28/11 (JSC): TaskID=116682
  Update css.awt.UnoControlDialog to reflect the supported XDialog2 interface
  additionally to XDialog
