     getWord:                   Dampfschiffahrt
     getPossibleHyphens:            Dampf=schiff=fahrt
     getOrigHyphensPositions:   4, 9

     between the double "ff" (9). And if you are going to hyphenate it at
     position 9 you will get an additional "f" before the hyphen
     character.</P>
