/** provides a proofreader (often known as grammar checker) for text

    <p>An implementation of this service will receive text and has to identify
    the sentence end and report all errors found.</p>

    <p>An implementation of this service is not limited to grammar checking at all.
    It might also check style, used terms etc. Basically it can check every
    aspect of a single sentence. Since the text provided is always the complete
    paragraph it can also choose to analyze the context of the sentence currently
    required to be checked. However error reports need to be limited to the
    current sentence.</p>
