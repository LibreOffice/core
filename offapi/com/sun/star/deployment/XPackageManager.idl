/** The <type>XPackageManager</type> interface is used to add or remove
    packages to a specific repository. This interface represents a particular
    repository.
    Packages are deployable files, e.g. scripts or UNO components.
    <p>
    Adding an UNO package means that a copy of the package is stored
    in the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
    Removing an UNO package means that the previously added package is
    removed from the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
    All interface methods do neither register nor revoke an extension.
    This happens exclusively by <type>XExtensionManager</type>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Objects of this interface are created using the
    <type>XPackageManagerFactory</type> service resp. the singleton
    <code>
