/** An interaction request handler that lets the user handle requests via GUI dialogs.

    <p>The interaction handler service has a number of <a href="#built_in_handler">built-in handlers</a>, responsible
    for a lot of well known interactions. Additionally, there's a configuration module which allows to
    <a href="#configuring_handlers">configure additional handlers</a>, responsible for arbitrary requests.</a></p>

    <a name="built_in_handler"></a>
    <h3>Built-in Handlers</h3>
    The following well-known requests can be dealt with by the built-in handlers:
    <UL>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::AuthenticationRequest</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::CertificateValidationRequest</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveAugmentedIOException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveFileIOException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveIOException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveNetworkConnectException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveNetworkException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveNetworkGeneralException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveNetworkOffLineException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveNetworkReadException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveNetworkResolveNameException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveNetworkWriteException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveWrongMediumException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::task::PasswordRequest</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::java::WrongJavaVersionException*</LI>
        <LI>com::sun::star::task::DocumentMacroConfirmationRequest</LI>
    </UL>
    The requests marked with an asterisk are only handled if (a) their
    continuations match certain restrictions (see below), and (b) the
    necessary resource strings are available (this can be exploited by
    applications that carry only a subset of all resource files with
    them).</P>

    <P>The continuation restrictions are as follows:  Let <VAR>C</VAR> be the
    subset of the provided continuations that are of type
    com::sun::star::task::XInteractionApprove,
    com::sun::star::task::XInteractionDisapprove,
    com::sun::star::task::XInteractionRetry, or
    com::sun::star::task::XInteractionAbort (or of a
    derived type).  All other continuations are ignored for these requests.
    The request is only handled if the set <VAR>C</VAR> is any of the
    following:
    <UL>
        <LI>Abort</LI>
        <LI>Retry, Abort</LI>
        <LI>Approve</LI>
        <LI>Approve, Abort</LI>
        <LI>Approve, Disapprove</LI>
        <LI>Approve, Disapprove, Abort</LI>
    </UL></P>

    <P>An
    com::sun::star::ucb::InteractiveAugmentedIOException
    carries with it a sequence of arguments, which should be
    com::sun::star::beans::PropertyValues.  The following
    details which properties are interpreted by the interaction handler,
    depending on the request's
    com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode:
    <DL>
        <DT><code>"Uri"</code></DT>
        <DD>All error codes except
        com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode::DIFFERENT_DEVICES.
        The URI of the involved resource (a `string`).</DD>

        <DT><code>"ResourceName"</code></DT>
        <DD>All error codes except
        com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode::DIFFERENT_DEVICES.
        A name for the involved resource (a `string`) that might be
        more meaningful to the user than the URI.  For example, a
        (platform-dependent) path notation for file system resources.</DD>

        <DT><code>"ResourceType"</code></DT>
        <DD>com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode::DEVICE_NOT_READY
        and
        com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode::NOT_EXISTING
        only.  An identifier for the type of resource involved (a
        `string`).  Currently understood values are
        <code>"volume"</code> (e.g., a file system volume) and
        <code>"folder"</code> (i.e., a resource that contains other
        resources).</DD>

        <DT><code>"Removable"</code></DT>
        <DD>com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode::NOT_EXISTING
        only.  A flag indicating whether the resource resides on a storage
        medium that can be removed by the user (a `boolean`).</DD>

        <DT><code>"Folder"</code></DT>
        <DD>com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode::CANT_CREATE
        only.  The name of the folder in which a resource cannot be created (a
        `string`).</DD>

        <DT><code>"Volume"</code> and <code>"OtherVolume"</code></DT>
        <DD>com::sun::star::ucb::IOErrorCode::DIFFERENT_DEVICES
        only.  The names of the two volumes involved (two
        `string`s).</DD>
    </DL></P>

    <a name="configuring_handlers"></a>
    <h3>Configuring additional Handlers</h3>

    <p>It is possible to configure additional interaction handlers, to which certain requests can be delegated. The
    configuration node <code>/org.openoffice.Interaction/InteractionHandlers</code> is evaluated and respected
    by the <code>InteractionHandler</code> implementation.</p>

    <p>A custom interaction handler can declare itself responsible for an arbitrary number of UNO types, specified
    by full-qualified type name. Also, for each type, it can specify whether it is responsible for only this particular
    type, or all possibly existent derived types.</p>

    <p>Whenever the <code>InteractionHandler</code> encounters a request it cannot fulfill itself, it will examine
    the configuration, to find a handler implementation for the request, and delegate it to the first matching
    handler.</p>

    <p>If multiple custom interaction handlers declare themselves responsible for the same request type, it is not
    defined which handler will actually be invoked. Thus, when deploying a custom interaction handler, ensure
    that the types you specify are general enough to cover all requests you want to handle, but also specific
    enough to not cover requests which other handlers might be interested in.</p>
