/** specifies a job which must be executed asynchronously

    <p>
    Instead of <type>XJob</type> the implementation of this interface
    must be aware, that execution can be made real asynchronous (e.g. by using
    threads). Because the environment whish to have creation and using of threads
    under control, it's not allowed for a real job implementation to use such mechanism
    by itself. The outside code decide, if it's possible and how it can be made
    asynchronous. In some special cases it can be, that asynchronous jobs will be executed
    synchronously.

        @param Arguments
            are arguments for executing the job. Their semantics is completely implementation dependent. Usually,
            a concrete implementation of a job specifies in its service descriptions which parameters are allowed
            (or expected). This values are persistent by the configuration of the <type>JobExecutor</type>
            which use this asynchronous job. It's possible to write it back by called listener
            function <member>XJobListener::jobFinished()</member>.

        @param Listener
            specifies a listener which should be notified on events. May be <NULL/>.

        @throws com::sun::star::lang::IllegalArgumentException
            if some of given arguments doesn't fill out the service specification or
            was corrupt so the service couldn't work correctly
