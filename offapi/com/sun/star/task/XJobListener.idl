        @param Job
            identifies the asynchronous job so the <type>JobExecutor</type>
            can differ between more then ones.

        @param Result
            should be the same like for the synchronous mode on <member>XJob::execute()</member>.
            It provides information about success or failure of job execution. It's possible too,
            to use special protocol (which depends from real implementation) between
            <type>JobExecutor</type> and a real job. So it can be possible to:

            <ul>
                <li>deregister the job</li>
                <li>let him registered although execution was successfully(!)</li>
                <li>make some job specific data persistent inside the job configuration which
                    is provided by the executor.</li>
            </ul>
