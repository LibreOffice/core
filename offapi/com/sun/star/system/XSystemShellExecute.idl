        @param aCommand
        Specifies the command to execute. This may be an executable file or a
        document which is registered with an application on a specific platform,
        so that the platform knows what application to launch for that document.
        If the command specifies a path to an executable, etc, this has to be

        Specifies a list of space separated parameters. The method does not
        validate the given parameters, but only passes it as a parameter to the
        specified command.

        @param nFlags
        Specifies different flags to control the execution of this method, for example,
        avoid showing system error messages, in case of failures, etc.
