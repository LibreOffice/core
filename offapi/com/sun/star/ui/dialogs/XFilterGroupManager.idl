    /** Appends a group of filters to the current filter list.

        <p>It is implementation dependent how the filter groups are presented to the user.<br/>
        It is not even guaranteed that the groups are visualized: implementations are free to simply
        append all the filters separately, with ignoring the group title.</p>

    @param sGroupTitle
        The title of the filter group. Usually, the caller should localize this title, as it is to be presented to
        the user.

    @param aFilters
        The filters which form a group. Every filter consists of two strings, where the first one is a display name
        (as for <arg>sGroupTitle</arg>, it holds that these strings should be localized), and the second one the
        semicolon separated list of wildcard expressions for the filter.<br/>
        Usually, the expressions are simply extensions (e.g. "*.txt"), but this must no necessarily be the case.

    @throws com::sun::star::lang::IllegalArgumentException
    if one or more filters in the given filter list already exist.
