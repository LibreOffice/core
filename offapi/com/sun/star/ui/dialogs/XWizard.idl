/** is the main interface implemented by the <type>Wizard</type> services.

    <p>A wizard is a dialog which guides the user through a number of tasks (usually input of data), which the user can
    accomplish either sequentially or out-of-order. For this, a wizard is comprised of a number of tab pages,
    each page representing a single <em>step</em>.</p>

    <p>Sequential navigation in a wizard is done via a <em>Next</em> and a <em>Back</em> button. Non-sequential navigation
    is done via a roadmap, which is displayed on the left hand side of the wizard dialog, lists all available
    steps, and allows jumping to a certain step (where the creator of the wizard can restrict the available steps
    depending on the current situation in the wizard, see below).</p>

    <p>A sequence of steps in a wizard dialog is called a <em>path</em>. A given wizard can support one or multiple paths,
    which are declared at the time of construction of the wizard.</p>

    <p>In the simplest case, where the wizard supports only one path, all available steps are displayed in the roadmap,
    and the user can simply travel through them as desired.</p>

    <p>If the wizard is more complex, and supports multiple paths, things become more complicated. In a given situation
    of the wizard, where the user is at step <em>k</em> of the current path, the <em>potential</em> or <em>conflicting</em>
    paths are those whose first <em>k</em> steps are the same as in the current path. Obviously, there's at least one
    potential path in every situation: the current one. If there is more than one, then the future steps in the dialog
    are not finally decided. In such a case, the roadmap will display future steps up to the point where the potential
    paths diverge, and then an item <quot><code>...</code></quot> indicating that the order of steps is undecided.</p>

    <p>An <type>XWizardController</type> can declare a certain path as active path by calling the <member>activatePath</member>
    method. Usually, this is done depending on user input. For instance, your wizard could have radio buttons on the
    first page which effectively decide about which path to take in the wizard.</p>

    <p>Single steps in the wizard can be freely enabled and disabled, using the <member>enablePage</member> method.
    Disabled pages are skipped during sequential traveling, and not selectable in the roadmap.</p>

    <p>The state of the <em>Next</em> button in the dialog will be automatically maintained in most situations,
    depending on the results of calls to the <member>XWizardController::canAdvance</member> and <member>XWizardPage::canAdvance</member>
    methods. More sophisticated wizard logic, however, will need manual calls to the <member>enableButton</member> method.
    Also, the <em>Finish</em> button needs to be maintained by the wizard's controller, too, as it cannot be decided
    generically in which situations it should be enabled or disabled.</p>

    /** activates a path

        <p>If the wizard has been created with multiple paths of control flow, then this method allows switching to
        another path.</p>

        <p>You can only activate a path which shares the first <code>k</code> pages with the path
        which is previously active (if any), where <code>k</code> is the index of the current page within the current
        path.</p>

        <p><strong>Example</strong>: Say you have paths, <code>(0,1,2,5)</code> and <code>(0,1,4,5)</code> (with
        the numbers denoting page IDs). This means that after page <code>1</code>, you either continue with page
        <code>2</code> or state <code>4</code>,and after this, you finish in state <code>5</code>.<br/>
        Now if the first path is active, and your current state is <code>1</code>, then you can easily switch to the
        second path, since both paths start with <code>(0,1)</code>.<br/>
        However, if your current state is <code>2</code>, then you can not switch to the second path anymore.</p>

        @param PathIndex
            the index of the path, as used in the <member>Wizard::createMultiplePathsWizard</member> constructor.
        @param Final
            <p>If <TRUE/>, the path will be completely activated, even if it is a conflicting path (i.e. there is another
            path which shares the first <code>k</code> states with the to-be-activated path.)</p>

            <p>If <FALSE/>, then the new path is checked for conflicts with other paths. If such conflicts exists, the path
            is not completely activated, but only up to the point where it does <em>not</em> conflict.</p>

            <p>In this latter case, you need another activatePath method (usually triggered by the user doing some decisions
            and entering some data on the reachable pages) before the wizard can actually be finished.</p>

            <p>With the paths in the example above, if you activate the second path, then only steps <code>0</code> and
            <code>1</code> are activated, since they are common to both paths. Steps <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>,
            and <code>5</code> are not reachable, yet.</p>

        @throws ::com::sun::star::container::NoSuchElementException
            if there is no path with the given index
        @throws ::com::sun::star::util::InvalidStateException
            if the path cannot be activated in the current state of the wizard.
