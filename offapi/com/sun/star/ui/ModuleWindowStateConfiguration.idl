        An implementation must provide a <type scope="com::sun::star::uno">Sequence</type> which
        has <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue</type> as entries. The following
        entries a defined:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Docked</b><br>a boolean which specifies if the window is docked or not.</li>
            <li><b>DockingArea</b><br>a <type scope="com::sun::star::ui">DockingArea</type>
            which specifies the docking area where the window is docked.</li>
            <li><b>DockPos</b><br>a <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">Point</type> which specifies the
            docked position of a window. The X and Y values are interpreted as a row/column number and
            a pixel position for top/bottom docked windows. For left/right docked windows this is</li>
            <li><b>DockSize</b><br>a <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">Size</type> which specifies
            the docked size of the window. This property is currently not used by the layout manager
            implementation. For future use.</li>
            <li><b>Locked</b><br>a boolean which specifies if the window is locked or not. This property
            is only valid for docked windows</li>
            <li><b>Pos</b><br>a <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">Point</type> which specifies the
            floating position in pixel of the window.</li>
            <li><b>Size</b><br>a <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">Size</type> which specifies the
            floating size in pixel of the window.</li>
            <li><b>Style</b><br>a long which specifies the style of the window. A toolbar support the
            following values: 0 = icons, 1 = text, 2 = text+icons.</li>
            <li><b>UIName</br><br>a localized string which specifies the default window title.</li>
        </ul>
        The key to a user interface element is the resource URL which has
        the following syntax "private:resource/$type/$name". For example "private:resource/toolbar/standardbar"
        addresses the standard bar of a module.
        A complete list of all user interface elements is available in the Developers Guide.
