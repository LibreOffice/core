        This call needs careful usage as data loss can occur. If the
        implementation has modified data and a new storage is set the
        implementation is not allowed to write back the data to the old
        storage. This must be done explicitly with <member>store</member>.

        created and initialize by the document model or the module user
        interface configuration supplier. Normally there is no need to
        set a storage for a user interface configuration manager. If a
        copy of the configuration data to another storage should be made,
        use <member>storeToStorage</member>.
