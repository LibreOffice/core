        <p>
        It provides a fast mapping, which is e.g. needed by a menu or toolbar implementation.
        E.g. a sub menu is described by a list of commands - and the implementation of the menu
        must show the corresponding shortcuts. Iteration over all items of this configuration
        set can be very expensive.

        Instead to the method getKeyEventsForCommand() the returned list contains only
        one(!) key event bound to one(!) requested command. If more then one key event
        is bound to a command - a selection is done inside this method.
        This internal selection cant be influenced from outside.

                    must have an accelerator - we cant reject the call if at least one command
                    does not occur inside this configuration set ...
