        canvas to a place on another.<p>

        This method copies a rectangular area from a place of one
        canvas to a place on another. Source and destination areas are
        permitted to overlap. If the source view or render state has a
        clipping set, the regions clipped away from the source
        rectangle are regarded fully transparent for the copy
        operation. The device color for both source and destination
        render state is ignored, the compositing mode only for the
        source render state.<p>

        @param sourceCanvas
        Canvas from which to copy the bitmap data. Can be identical to
        the canvas this method is called on, but must be valid.

        @param sourceRect
        Rectangle from which to copy the bitmap data. This rectangle
        is subject to both view and render transformation, before
        being applied. Thus, on screen, it does not necessarily
        resemble a rectangle any more. The rectangle must be
        non-empty, see
        <type scope="::com::sun::star::geometry">RealRectangle2D</type>
        for details.

        @param sourceViewState
        The view state to apply to the source of this copy
        operation. The view transformation must be non-singular.

        @param sourceRenderState
        The render state to apply to the source of this copy
        operation. The render transformation must be non-singular, and
        the compositing mode must be one of the
        <type>CompositingOperation</type> values.

        @param destRect
        Rectangle into which to copy the bitmap data. This rectangle
        is subject to both view and render transformation, before
        being applied. Thus, on screen, it does not necessarily
        resemble a rectangle any more. The rectangle must be
        non-empty, see
        <type scope="::com::sun::star::geometry">RealRectangle2D</type>
        for details.

        @param destViewState
        The view state to apply to the destination of this copy
        operation. The view transformation must be non-singular.

        @param destRenderState

        The render state to apply to the destination of this copy
        operation. The render transformation must be non-singular, and
        the compositing mode must be one of the
        <type>CompositingOperation</type> values.
