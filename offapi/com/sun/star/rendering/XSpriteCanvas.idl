/** Specialization of a XBitmapCanvas, where moving, animated objects
    (called sprites) are supported.

    @attention The screen output of canvas drawing operations is
    undefined, unless XSpriteCanvas::updateScreen() is called. This is
    because a sprite canvas might choose to employ double buffering to
    reduce animation flicker, and cannot know the instant suitable to
    display the newly rendered canvas content. When using external
    double-buffering via XBufferController on a sprite canvas, the
    implementation takes care of this issue, and in this case is able
    to render correctly even without explicit updateScreen() calls
    (because there's a defined moment in time where content display
    can happen, namely the XBufferController::showBuffer()) call. If
    you don't need sprite functionality, and don't want the
    updateScreen hassle, simply use the XBitmapCanvas.
