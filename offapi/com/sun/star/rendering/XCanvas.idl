/** Central interface for rendering.<p>

    This is the central interface for graphical output production, and
    the place where all draw methods are located.<p>

    Some notes are in order to explain the concepts used here. The
    <type>XCanvas</type> interface is free of client-modifiable state,
    i.e. it can be used safely and without external synchronization in
    a multi-threaded environment. On the other hand, this implies that
    for nearly every canvas operation, external state is
    required. This is provided by <type>ViewState</type> and
    <type>RenderState</type> in a unified fashion, supplemented by a
    few extra state parameters for some methods (e.g. textured
    polygons or text rendering).<p>

    When used careless, this scheme can be inefficient to some extend,
    because internally, view, render and other states have to be
    combined before rendering. This is especially expensive for
    complex clip polygons, i.e. when both <type>ViewState</type> and
    <type>RenderState</type> have a complex clip polygon set, which
    have to be intersected before rendering. It is therefore
    recommended to combine <type>ViewState</type> and
    <type>RenderState</type> already at the client side, when objects
    are organized in a hierarchical way: the classic example are
    grouped draw shapes, whose parent group object imposes a
    common clipping and a common transformation on its siblings. The
    group object would therefore merge the <type>ViewState</type> and
    the <type>RenderState</type> it is called with into a new
    <type>ViewState</type>, and call its siblings with a
    <type>RenderState</type> containing only the local offset (and no
    extra clipping).<p>

    Further on, this stateless nature provides easy ways for
    caching. Every non-trivial operation on <type>XCanvas</type> can
    return a cache object, which, when called to redraw, renders the
    primitive usually much more quickly than the original method. Note
    that such caching is a lot more complicated, should the actual
    rendering a method yields depend on internal state (which is the
    case e.g. for the
    <type
    scope="::com::sun::star::drawing">::com::sun::star::drawing::XGraphics</type>
    interface).  Please note, though, that deciding whether to return
    an <type>XCachedPrimitive</type> is completely up to the
    implementation - don't rely on the methods returning something
    (this is because there might be cases when returning such a cache
    object will actually be a pessimization, since it involves memory
    allocation and comparisons).<p>

    Things that need more than a small, fixed amount of data are
    encapsulated in own interfaces, e.g. polygons and bitmaps. You
    can, in principle, roll your own implementations of these
    interfaces, wrap it around your internal representation of
    polygons and bitmaps, and render them. It might just not be overly
    fast, because the <type>XCanvas</type> would need to convert for
    each render call. It is therefore recommended to create such
    objects via the <type>XGraphicDevice</type> factory (to be
    retrieved from every canvas object via the
    <member>getDevice()</member> call) - they will then internally
    optimize to the underlying graphics subsystem.<p>
