/** Central interface for rendering.<p>

    This is the central interface for graphical output production, and
    the place where all draw methods are located.<p>

    Some notes are in order to explain the concepts used here. The
    XCanvas interface is free of client-modifiable state,
    i.e. it can be used safely and without external synchronization in
    a multi-threaded environment. On the other hand, this implies that
    for nearly every canvas operation, external state is
    required. This is provided by ViewState and
    RenderState in a unified fashion, supplemented by a
    few extra state parameters for some methods (e.g. textured
    polygons or text rendering).<p>

    When used careless, this scheme can be inefficient to some extend,
    because internally, view, render and other states have to be
    combined before rendering. This is especially expensive for
    complex clip polygons, i.e. when both ViewState and
    RenderState have a complex clip polygon set, which
    have to be intersected before rendering. It is therefore
    recommended to combine ViewState and
    RenderState already at the client side, when objects
    are organized in a hierarchical way: the classic example are
    grouped draw shapes, whose parent group object imposes a
    common clipping and a common transformation on its siblings. The
    group object would therefore merge the ViewState and
    the RenderState it is called with into a new
    ViewState, and call its siblings with a
    RenderState containing only the local offset (and no
    extra clipping).<p>

    Further on, this stateless nature provides easy ways for
    caching. Every non-trivial operation on XCanvas can
    return a cache object, which, when called to redraw, renders the
    primitive usually much more quickly than the original method. Note
    that such caching is a lot more complicated, should the actual
    rendering a method yields depend on internal state (which is the
    case e.g. for the
    ::com::sun::star::awt::XGraphics
    interface).  Please note, though, that deciding whether to return
    an XCachedPrimitive is completely up to the
    implementation - don't rely on the methods returning something
    (this is because there might be cases when returning such a cache
    object will actually be a pessimization, since it involves memory
    allocation and comparisons).<p>

    Things that need more than a small, fixed amount of data are
    encapsulated in own interfaces, e.g. polygons and bitmaps. You
    can, in principle, roll your own implementations of these
    interfaces, wrap it around your internal representation of
    polygons and bitmaps, and render them. It might just not be overly
    fast, because the XCanvas would need to convert for
    each render call. It is therefore recommended to create such
    objects via the XGraphicDevice factory (to be
    retrieved from every canvas object via the
    getDevice() call) - they will then internally
    optimize to the underlying graphics subsystem.<p>

        fast render speed, the bitmap should be created by the
        corresponding XGraphicDevice's
        XGraphicDevice::createCompatibleBitmap()
        method. The bitmap's color channel values are multiplied with
        the device color values as specified in the render state.<p>

        @param xBitmap
        The bitmap to render.

        The view state to be used when drawing this text.

        @param aRenderState
        The render state to be used when drawing this text. The device
        color entry in the render state is multiplied with every pixel
        color value, and only the result is rendered into the
        canvas. If, for example, the bitmap should be rendered with
        increased global transparency, set all device color channels
        to 1.0, except for the alpha channel, which should be set to
        the desired transparency.
