/** This is a specialized interface for bitmaps having integer color

    interface only permits read-only access.<p>

    Use this interface for e.g. bitmaps that are calculated
    on-the-fly, or that are pure functional, and thus cannot be
    modified.<p>

    If you get passed an instance of
    XIntegerReadOnlyBitmap that also supports the
    XVolatileBitmap interface, things become a bit more
    complicated. When reading data, one has to check for both
    VolatileContentDestroyedException and mismatching
    IntegerBitmapLayout return values. If either of them
    occurs, the whole bitmap read operation should be repeated, if you
    need consistent information.<p>

        occupies less than a byte), the leftover content of the bytes
        at the right of each scanline is filled with zeros. The
