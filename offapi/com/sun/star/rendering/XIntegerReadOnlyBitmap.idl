    Use this interface for e.g. bitmaps that are calculated
    on-the-fly, or that are pure functional, and thus cannot be
    modified.<p>

    If you get passed an instance of
    <type>XIntegerReadOnlyBitmap</type> that also supports the
    <type>XVolatileBitmap</type> interface, things become a bit more
    complicated. When reading data, one has to check for both
    <type>VolatileContentDestroyedException</type> and mismatching
    <type>IntegerBitmapLayout</type> return values. If either of them
    occurs, the whole bitmap read operation should be repeated, if you
    need consistent information.<p>
