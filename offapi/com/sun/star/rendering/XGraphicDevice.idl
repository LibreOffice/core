/** This interface provides access to a graphic device, such as a
    printer, or a screen device. Every canvas (@see XCanvas) has
    exactly one associated graphic device, into which its output is
    rendered.

    For a typical windowing system, the graphic device is equivalent
    to a distinct OS window, with it's own clipped output area,
    fullscreen and double-buffering attributes. That is, even if one
    can have multiple canvases per system window, they all share the
    same graphic device and thus e.g. fullscreen state. If the OS
    restrictions are in such a way that fullscreen or double-buffering
    is screen-exclusive, i.e. that per screen, only one object can
    have this state, it might even be that all windows on the screen
    share a common graphic device.

        this is not advisable: each canvas implementation is free to
        internally generate optimized parametric polygons, which can
        be used more directly for e.g. texturing operations.

        <pre>
        Available services (all canvas implementations should provide
        this minimal set, though are free to add more; just check the
        getAvailableServiceNames() on the returned interface):

        - Gradients - all gradients need to support two construction
          parameters, "Colors" being a <type>sequence<Color></type>
          and "Stops" being a <type>sequence<double></type>. Both must
          have the same length, and at least two elements. See
          http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#GradientStops for
          the semantics of gradient stops and colors.
          Required gradient services:

          * "LinearGradient" - the gradient varies linearly between
            the given colors. without coordinate system
            transformation, the color interpolation happens in
            increasing x direction, and is constant in y
            direction. Equivalent to svg linear gradient
            http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#LinearGradients

          * "EllipticalGradient" - this gradient has zeroth color
            index in the middle, and varies linearly between center
            and final color. The services takes an additional
            parameter named "AspectRatio" of <type>double</type>
            (width divided by height), if this aspect ratio is 1, the
            gradient is circular. If it's not 1, the gradient is
            elliptical, with the special twist that the aspect ratio
            is maintained also for the center color: the gradient will
            not collapse into a single point, but become a line of
            center color. If "AspectRatio" is missing, or equal to 1,
            this gradient yields similar results as the svg radial
            gradient
            http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/pservers.html#RadialGradients

          * "RectangularGradient" - this gradient has zeroth color
            index in the middle, and varies linearly between center
            and final color via rectangular boxes
            around the center point. The services takes an additional
            parameter named "AspectRatio" of <type>double</type>
            (width divided by height), if this aspect ratio is 1, the
            gradient is quadratic. If it's not 1, the gradient is
            rectangular, with the special twist that the aspect ratio
            is maintained also for the center color: the gradient will
            not collapse into a single point, but become a line of
            center color.

        - Hatch patterns - Required hatch services:

          * "VerticalLineHatch" - this hatching consists of vertical lines
          * "OrthogonalLinesHatch" - this hatching consists of
            crossing vertical and horizontal lines
          * "ThreeCrossingLinesHatch" - this hatching consists of
            vertical and horizontal lines plus diagonal lines from
            left, top to bottom, right.
          * "FourCrossingLinesHatch" - this hatching consists of
            vertical and horizontal lines plus diagonal lines in both
            directions.
        </pre>
