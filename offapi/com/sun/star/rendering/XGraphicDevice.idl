/** This interface provides access to a graphic device, such as a
    printer, or a screen device. Every canvas (@see XCanvas) has
    exactly one associated graphic device, into which its output is
    rendered.

    For a typical windowing system, the graphic device is equivalent
    to a distinct OS window, with it's own clipped output area,
    fullscreen and double-buffering attributes. That is, even if one
    can have multiple canvases per system window, they all share the
    same graphic device and thus e.g. fullscreen state. If the OS
    restrictions are in such a way that fullscreen or double-buffering
    is screen-exclusive, i.e. that per screen, only one object can
    have this state, it might even be that all windows on the screen
    share a common graphic device.
