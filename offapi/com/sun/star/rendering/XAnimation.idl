        Note that it is perfectly legal to e.g. map t in a nonlinear
        fashion to internal frames, for example to achieve
        acceleration or deceleration effects. It is required that the
        render method has const semantics, i.e. when called with the
        same parameter set, identical output must be generated. This
        is because e.g. a Sprite might decide arbitrarily to render an
        animation once and cache the result, or repaint it via
        XAnimation::render everytime.<p>

        The rendered content, although, must be exactly the same for
        identical viewState, canvas and t values. Or, for that
        matters, must call the same canvas methods in the same order
        with the same parameter sets, for identical viewState and t
        values. Furthermore, when viewState has the identity
        transformation set, rendered output must be contained in a
        rectangle with upper left corner at (0,0) and width and height
        given by the AnimationAttributes' untransformedSize
        member. Any content exceeding this box might get clipped off.<p>

        @param canvas
        The target canvas to render this animation to.

        @param viewState
        The view state to be used when rendering this animation to the
        target canvas. The view transformation matrix must not be
        singular.

        @param t
        Time instant for which animation content is requested. The
        range must always be [0,1], where 0 denotes the very beginning, and
        1 the end of the animation sequence.

        @throws <type>com::sun::star::lang::IllegalArgumentException</type>
        if one of the passed parameters does not lie in the specified,
        permissible range.
