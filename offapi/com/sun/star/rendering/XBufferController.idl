        The method returns, when the switching of the buffer is
        successfully scheduled, or immediately when an error
        occurs. If the switch was successful, subsequent render
        operations will be directed to the new backbuffer. Note that,
        if the buffer switching is exceedingly slow, or the frequency
        of switchBuffer() is exceedingly high, the buffer scheduled
        for display here might become the current render target
        <em>before</em> it is fully displayed on screen. In this case,
        any rendering operation to this buffer will block, until it is
        safe to perform the operation without visible cluttering.<p>

        necessarily require your screen display to be in sync with
        other things, e.g. sound playback.<p>
