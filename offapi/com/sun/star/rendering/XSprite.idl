    /** Apply a clipping to the shape output.<p>

        The given clip poly-polygon is always interpreted in device
        coordinate space. As the sprite has its own local coordinate
        system, with its origin on screen being equal to its current
        position, the clip poly-polygon's origin will always coincide
        with the sprite's origin. Furthermore, if any sprite
        transformation is set via transform(), the clip is subject to
        this transformation, too. The implementation is free, if it
        has a cached representation of the sprite at hand, to
        clip-output only this cached representation (e.g. a bitmap),
        instead of re-rendering the sprite from first principles. This
        is usually the case for an implementation of a
        XCustomSprite interface, since it typically has
        no other cached pictorial information at hand.<p>

        Specifying an empty interface denotes no clipping,
        i.e. everything contained in the sprite will be visible
        (subject to device-dependent constraints, of
        course). Specifying an empty XPolyPolygon2D, i.e. a
        poly-polygon containing zero polygons, or an XPolyPolygon2D
        with any number of empty sub-polygons, denotes the NULL
        clip. That means, nothing from the sprite will be visible.<p>

        words, the closer to the screen surface the sprite is shown.<p>

        @param nPriority
        New sprite priority value to serve as the sort key when
