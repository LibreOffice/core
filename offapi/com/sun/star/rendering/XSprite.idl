        system, with its origin on screen being equal to its current
        position, the clip poly-polygon's origin will always coincide
        with the sprite's origin. The implementation is free, if it
        has a cached representation of the sprite at hand, to
        clip-output only this cached representation (e.g. a bitmap),
        instead of re-rendering the sprite from first principles. This

        priority, the later will the sprite be rendered, or, in other
        words, the closer to the screen surface the sprite is shown.<p>

        @param nPriority
        New sprite priority value to serve as the sort key when
        determining sprite rendering order. Avoid NaNs and other
        irregular floating point values here, the order position for
        sprites with such a priority value is undefined.
