        One can do symbolic path construction with this method. The
        poly-polygons added by this method are not joined in the sense
        that they participate in mutual fill rule calculations like
        the polygons inside a single poly-polygon do. When rendering
        such a poly-polygon without transparency, it will look like the
        constituting poly-polygons rendered separately on top of
        another. Alas, when rendering with transparency, separate
        rendering will combine the alpha of overlapping areas, whereas
        addPolyPolygon results in constant alpha, regardless how many
        internal poly-polygons overlap at a single place.

        @param position
        The poly-polygon will be added at the given position, i.e. the
        upper, left edge of the referenced poly-polygon will be at
        this position relative to the target poly-polygon.

        @param polyPolygon
        The poly-polygon to add. Note that the content of this
        poly-polygon is copied, later changes to polyPolygon will have
        no effect on the poly-polygon it was added to.
