/** Contains all information needed to define a texture.<p>

    This structure contains all information necessary to define a
    texture. A texture describes the filled area of polygonal shapes,
    providing its own transformation matrix, repeat mode, and
    transparency.<p>

    To achieve uniformity, if this texture has a bitmap set, it is
    scaled in such a way that it will cover the same [0,1]x[0,1] box
    as the hatch and the gradient. The transformation member can then
    be used to scale the complete texture as it fits suit.<p>

        This member allows arbitrary transformations of the texture,
        relative to the textured primitive. Thus, the total
        transformation from the [0,1]x[0,1] texture space to the
        device coordinate space is the concatenation of texture,
        render state, and view state transformation (with only render
        state and view state transformation being applied to the
        textured primitive).<p>

        these parts, the start of the interval is plugged into the
        getOutline method. For example, if numberOfHatchPolygons is 2,
        then getOutline is called twice, once with 0.0 and once with
        0.5. Use this parameter to control the density of the
