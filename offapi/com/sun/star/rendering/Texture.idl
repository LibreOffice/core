    This structure contains all information necessary to define a
    texture. A texture describes the filled area of polygonal shapes,
    providing its own transformation matrix, repeat mode, and
    transparency.<p>

    To achieve uniformity, if this texture has a bitmap set, it is
    scaled in such a way that it will cover the same [0,1]x[0,1] box
    as the hatch and the gradient. The transformation member can then
    be used to scale the complete texture as it fits suit.<p>

        render state, and view state transformation (with only render
