/** Interface to control a custom sprite object on a XSpriteCanvas.<p>

    Every change performed on XCustomSprite objects is only visible
    after a XSpriteCanvas::updateScreen() call, to facilitate
    synchronized screen updates.

    TODO: Maybe more than alpha has to be overridden from render state.
    TODO: Provide means to change the output area

{

    /** Query a render canvas for this sprite's content.<p>

        Whatever is rendered to this canvas will become visible on the
        screen only after a XSpriteCanvas::updateScreen() call at the
        associated sprite canvas. This canvas is not equivalent to the
        host canvas of the sprite. At the very least, all output
        happens relative to the sprite's upper left corner, i.e. the
        origin of the sprite's canvas device coordinate system will
        move with the sprite across the screen.

        @attention Everytime the XCustomSprite is updated, the content
        canvas must be quried via this method. You are, on the other
        hand, allowed to temporarily store the canvas while rendering
        a single sprite update. You might even store the canvas
        between subsequent calls to getContentCanvas(), but should be
        aware of the fact that the returned interface might be a
        different object everytime.

        @attention Since changes to the sprite content will become
        visible after a XSpriteCanvas::updateScreen(), calls to this
        method must be synchronized externally. Otherwise, the sprite
        content rendered to screen is undefined. This is nothing the
        XCustomSprite can or will manage by itself.

        @return the canvas the sprite content can be rendered into.
