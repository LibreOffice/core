/** Specialized interface for bitmaps containing half floats as their
    color components. Half floats are 16 bit wide, and some high-end
    GPUs already have them as supported frame buffer format. In
    contrast to XHalfFloatBitmap, this interface only
    permits read-only access.<p>

    Use this interface for e.g. bitmaps that are calculated
    on-the-fly, or that are pure functional, and thus cannot be
    modified.<p>

    If you get passed an instance of
    XHalfFloatReadOnlyBitmap that also supports the
    XVolatileBitmap interface, things become a bit more
    complicated. When reading data, one has to check for both
    VolatileContentDestroyedException and mismatching
    FloatingPointBitmapLayout return values. If either of them
    occurs, the whole bitmap read operation should be repeated.<p>

        bitmap, the same scanline padding takes place as when the
        whole bitmap is requested. Note: as we currently have no 16
        bit float UNO data type, the values are transported as 16 bit
        integers across the API (which requires casting on both
        sides).<p>
