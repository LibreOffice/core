/** Metrics global to the font, i.e. not specific to single
    glyphs. The font height is defined as
    ascent+descent+internalLeading, and therefore not explicitely
    included here.<p>

    Please note that when querying FontMetrics from an XCanvasFont
    interface, all values here are given relative to the font cell
    size. That means, the referenceCharWidth and/or
    ascent+descent+internalLeading will approximately (rounded to
    integer device resolution, or exactly, if fractional font
    rendering is enabled) match the referenceAdvancement/cellSize
    members of the FontRequest for which the XCanvasFont was
    queried. Please be aware that the values returned in this
    structure only map one-to-one to device pixel, if the combined
    rendering transformation for text output equals the identity
    transformation. Otherwise, the text output (and thus the resulting
    metrics) will be subject to that transformation. Depending on the
    underlying font technology, actual device output might be off by
    up to one device pixel from the transformed metrics.
