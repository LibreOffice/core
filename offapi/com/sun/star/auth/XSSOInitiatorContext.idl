        init should be called only once for contexts which don't support

        support mutual authentication. Additional calls produce undefined

        the SSO token received from the acceptor side in response to an
        authentication request. This token is ignored on the first call
        to init and should only be specified for the second call on a
        context supporting mutual authentication.

        the sequence of bytes to be sent to the acceptor side as part of
        an authentication request. This sequence will be non zero length
        for the first call to init, zero length for the second call to init
        on a context supporting mutual authentication and undefined in all
        other cases.
