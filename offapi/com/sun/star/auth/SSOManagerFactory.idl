/** represents a starting point for Single Signon interactions.
    <P>The Single Signon ( SSO ) apis provide UNO based access to underlying
       SSO implementations ( e.g. Kerberos ). The aim of the SSO apis is to
       enable authentication ( possibly mutual ) between a client ( source or
       initiator ) and a network service ( target or acceptor ). This is
       achieved via. the creation and processing of security tokens sent
       between the two parties. The steps which should be followed to
       successfully use the SSO apis are as follows:
    <UL>
        <LI>Create an <type>XSSOManagerFactory</type> instance</LI>
        <LI>Use this factory to create/retrieve an <type>XSSOManager</type>
            instance.</LI>
        <LI>Depending on whether your code is acting as SSO source or target,
            you should use the <type>XSSOManager</type> instance to create an
            initiator security context, <type>XSSOInitiatorContext</type> or an
            acceptor security context, <type>XSSOAcceptorContext</type>
            respectively.</LI>
        <LI>On the initiator side, use the previously created context to process
            security tokens received from the acceptor side and to create
            security tokens to send to the acceptor side. On the acceptor side,
            use the previously created context to process security tokens
            received from the initiator side and to create security tokens to
            send to the initiator side.</LI>
    </UL>
