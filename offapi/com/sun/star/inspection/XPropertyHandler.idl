        <p>This is usually used if your handler is used with another, more generic one, which

        <p>With this in mind, property handlers can only supersede properties which are supported
        by a handler preceding them, but not properties of handlers succeeding them.</p>

        factories, for handler <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> - in this order.

        <code>Bar</code>, and <code>B</code> supersedes both <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code>,
        them the result is <code>Bar</code> is still present. This is because <code>B</code> precedes
        <code>C</code>, so it cannot, by definition, supersede properties which are supported by
        <code>C</code>.</p>

        <p>Availability of this feature is indicated by the LineDescriptor::HasPrimaryButton

        <p>When this method is called, the property handler should raise the UI needed to enter the

        <p>It is recommended that property handlers do not directly set the property value which has
        been obtained from the user, but store it in the output-parameter Data, and return
        InteractiveSelectionResult::ObtainedValue.</p>

        <p>If a handler sets the new property value directly, and returns
        InteractiveSelectionResult::ObtainedValue, this implies that the property
        cannot properly be handled in case the object inspector is inspecting an intersection of
        multiple components, since in this case onInteractivePropertySelection()
        will be called at one handler only, however the new property would have to be forwarded to
        all handlers.</p>
