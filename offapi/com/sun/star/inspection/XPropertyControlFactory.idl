        <p>A XPropertyControlFactory can create any of the control types denoted by
        the PropertyControlType constants.</p>

            the type of the requested control

        @param CreateReadOnly
            determines whether the newly created control should be readonly.

            <p>If this argument is `TRUE`, this does not necessarily mean that the property cannot be
            changed at all in the ObjectInspector. Instead, an XPropertyHandler
            can still decide that there is a dedicated UI for entering the property value,
            which is usually triggered by a LineDescriptor::PrimaryButton.</p>

            <p>Note that this parameter might be ignored if the XObjectInspectorModel::IsReadOnly
            attribute is `TRUE`, in which case all created property controls must be readonly.</p>
