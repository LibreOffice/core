    <p>If the result for an item combination is empty, the value 0 is used for the difference, even
       if the summary function is undefined without values, like average or variance. The difference
       is shown in the result table even if the original result was empty.</p>

    <p>The difference for item combinations containing the base item is shown as empty result.</p>

    <p><b>Previous or Next</b></p>

       the next visible member of the base field, in the base field's sort order. If details for one
       item in the base field are hidden, that item is skipped. The difference for the item with
       hidden details isn't calculated, not even for the item's summary, to have a consistent order
       of previous and next items.</p>
