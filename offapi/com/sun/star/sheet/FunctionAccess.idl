        <p>If set to `TRUE`, the result of the function call will be
        calculated similar to array formulas in a spreadsheet document. The
        return value of the function call will usually be a sequence of
        sequences containing the values of the resulting array. Example: If the
        function ABS is called for a 3x2 cell range, the result will be a 3x2
        array containing the absolute values of the numbers contained in the
        specified cell range.</p>

        <p>If set to `FALSE`, the result of the function call will be
        calculated similar to simple cell formulas in a spreadsheet document.
        The return value of the function call will usually be a single value.
        Of course, some functions always return an array, for example the
        MUNIT function.</p>

        <p>For compatibility with older versions, the default value of this
        property is `TRUE`.</p>
