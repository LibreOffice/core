    <p>In more complex data sources, a dimension may contain several
    hierarchies, which consolidate items of a complex data type, called
    levels.</p>

    <p>Example: In a database, a column contains date values. This column
    will be a dimension of the data pilot source. One hierarchy may contain
    the 3 levels year, month, day. Another hierarchy may contain the 2 levels
    year and week number.</p>
