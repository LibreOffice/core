    <p>Every log record, as passed to XCsvLogFormatter::format(),
    will be formatted into a single row for a CSV file.
    The sequence number, the thread ID, the time of the logged event,
    the source class/method name will get logged alongside the message, if this
    is not disabled. The Formatter also supports logging an arbitrary number of
    user-defined columns. If the Formatter is configured to have more than one
    (user-defined) column the data to log has to be preformatted with the
    formatMultiColumn method.</p>
