        This call has to be used carefully as it removes the storage

        force the implementation to reload data from the previous storage
        before releasing it. The StringResourceManager will be modified
        after calling this method as the data isn't stored to the new
        storage yet. <member>storeAsStorage</member> should be prefered
        as it directly stores the data to the new storage and afterwards
        this storage is in sync with the resource data.
