        This call has to be used carefully as it removes the location

        force the implementation to reload data from the previous
        location before releasing it. The StringResourceManager will
        be modified after calling this method as the data isn't stored
        to the new location yet. <member>storeAsURL</member> should
        be prefered as it directly stores the data to the new location
        and afterwards this location is in sync with the resource data.
