    Supported URLs must match follow format:
    <code><i>protocol scheme</i>:<i>protocol specific part</i></code>
    If a handler provides optional arguments ("?") or jump marks ("#") depends from his
    definition and implementation. The generic dispatch provider will use registered
    URL pattern to detect right handler.

            for his agreement for the dispatched URL

        <p>
        Such asked handler can agree by returning itself or a special sub dispatch object, which
        can handle the given URL. Of course he can disagree with it by returning an empty reference.

        <p>
        Sometimes it can be useful for a handler object, to know something about the
        environment, in which it runs - especially the frame. For this case the generic
        code (which uses the handler) will ask for this optional interface and use it, if it exist.
        Following parameters are passed to the service:
        <ul>
        <li>sequence< any >[0] => the frame for which this ProtocolHandler was created [com.sun.star.frame.XFrame]</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        Please note: if this mechanism is used it seems not useful (nor possible) to implement a ProtocolHandler
        as a singleton. Otherwise the implementation can't distinguish between different environments
        and her corresponding dispatch requests.
        </p>
