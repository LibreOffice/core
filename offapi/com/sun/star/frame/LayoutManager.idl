    <p>
    Layout management is the process of determining the size and position of
    user interface elements. By default, each Frame has a layout
    manager -- it performs layout management for the user interface elements
    within the frame. User interface elements can provide size and alignment
    hints to layout managers, but layout managers have the final decision on
    the size and position of those user interface elements.
