/** serves state information of objects which can be connected to
        controls (e.g. toolbox controls).

    <p>
    Each state change is to be broadcasted to all registered
    status listeners. The first notification should be performed
    synchronously from XDispatch::addStatusListener();
        if not, controls may flicker. State listener must be aware of this
    synchronous notification.
    </p>

    <p>
    The state consists of enabled/disabled and a short descriptive text
    of the function (e.g. "undo insert character"). It is to be broadcasted
        whenever this state changes or the control should re-get the value
    for the URL it is connected to. Additionally, a context-switch-event
    is to be broadcasted whenever the object may be out of scope,
    to force the state listener to requery the XDispatch.
