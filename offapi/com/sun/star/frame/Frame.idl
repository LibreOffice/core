    Frames are the anchors for the office components and they are the component's link

    by building frame hierarchies. These hierarchies contains all currently loaded
    documents and make it possible to walk during these trees.

    to a global one which life time will be controlled by it.

        What kind of URLs a frame accepts in the calls to <member>XDispatchProvider::queryDispatch()</member>,
        and how the returned dispatcher handles dispatches is completely implementation dependent
        (though of course the restrictions of <type>XDispatchProvider</type> must be met).
        Frame implementations may (optionally) support special targets in the call to
        <member>XDispatchProvider::queryDispatch()</member>.
        Such special targets are passed as target frame name. They may, in addition,
        require special frame search flags (see <type>FrameSearchFlag</type>), or,
        in opposite, limit the set of allowed flags.<br>
        Common special targets include:
        <ul>
                        <li><b>_blank</b><br> is used to create a new frame when dispatching the URL.</li>
            <li><b>_default</b><br> is used to recycle empty or create a new frame when dispatching the URL.</li>
            <li><b>_self</b><br> forces the frame to dispatch the URL into itself. ("" means the same)</li>
                        <li><b>_parent</b><br> dispatches the URL into the parent frame.</li>
                        <li><b>_top</b><br> dispatches the URL into the top level frame, the frame where this is invoked belongs to.</li>

        Such recorder can be used to record dispatch requests.
        The supplier contains a dispatch recorder and provide the functionality
        to use it for any dispatch object from outside which supports the interface
        <type>XDispatch</type>. A supplier is available only, if recording was enabled.
        That means: if someone wishes to enable recoding on a frame he must set
        a supplier with a recorder object inside of it. Every user of dispatches
        has to check then if such supplier is available at this frame property.
        If value of this property is <NULL/> he must call <member>XDispatch::dispatch()</member>
        on the original dispatch object. If it's a valid value he must use the supplier
        by calling his method <member>XDispatchRecorderSupplier::dispatchAndRecord()</member>
        with the original dispatch object as argument.
        </p>

        <p>
        Note:<br>
        It's not recommended to cache an already gotten supplier. Because there exist
        no possibility to check for enabled/disabled recording then.
