        What kind of URLs a frame accepts in the calls to <member>XDispatchProvider::queryDispatch()</member>,
        and how the returned dispatcher handles dispatches is completely implementation dependent
        (though of course the restrictions of <type>XDispatchProvider</type> must be met).
        Frame implementations may (optionally) support special targets in the call to
        <member>XDispatchProvider::queryDispatch()</member>.
        Such special targets are passed as target frame name. They may, in addition,
        require special frame search flags (see <type>FrameSearchFlag</type>), or,
        in opposite, limit the set of allowed flags.<br>
        Common special targets include:
        <ul>
                        <li><b>_blank</b><br> is used to create a new frame when dispatching the URL.</li>
            <li><b>_default</b><br> is used to recycle empty or create a new frame when dispatching the URL.</li>
            <li><b>_self</b><br> forces the frame to dispatch the URL into itself. ("" means the same)</li>
                        <li><b>_parent</b><br> dispatches the URL into the parent frame.</li>
                        <li><b>_top</b><br> dispatches the URL into the top level frame, the frame where this is invoked belongs to.</li>

        The supplier contains a dispatch recorder and provide the functionality
        to use it for any dispatch object from outside which supports the interface
        <type>XDispatch</type>. A supplier is available only, if recording was enabled.
        That means: if someone wishes to enable recoding on a frame he must set
        a supplier with a recorder object inside of it. Every user of dispatches
        has to check then if such supplier is available at this frame property.
        If value of this property is <NULL/> he must call <member>XDispatch::dispatch()</member>
        on the original dispatch object. If it's a valid value he must use the supplier
        by calling his method <member>XDispatchRecorderSupplier::dispatchAndRecord()</member>
        with the original dispatch object as argument.
        </p>

        <p>
        Note:<br>
        It's not recommended to cache an already gotten supplier. Because there exist
        no possibility to check for enabled/disabled recording then.
