/** is an abstract service for a component which offers a more complex user interface
    to users within a status bar.

    <p>
    A generic status bar field is represented as a simple text field. A status
    bar controller can be added to a Statusbar and provide information or
    functions with a more sophisticated user interface.<br/>
    A typical example for status bar controller is a zoom chooser. It shows
    the current zoom and provides general zoom levels on a popup menu
    that can be activated by a mouse action for context menus.
