/** a singleton which provides information about user interface commands of modules.

    <p>
    OpenOffice.org has an amount of commands that can be used by user interface
    elements. This singleton provides access to the user interface commands that
    are part of OpenOffice.org modules, like Writer or Calc.
    </p>

    Provides access to user interface commands of the installed modules.

    <p>
    To access the user interface command description of a module, a unique module specifier
    must be provided to com::sun::star::container::XNameAccess::getByName() function.
    The module specifier can be retrieved from the com::sun::star::frame::ModuleManager
    service. The interface provides references to com::sun:star::ui::ModuleUICommandDescription.
    </p>

    @see com::sun::star::frame::ModuleManager

    Prior to LibreOffice 4.3, this singleton was only available as a
    (single-instance) UICommandDescription service.

    @since LibreOffice 4.3
