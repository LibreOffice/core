/** provides a <type>DispatchRecorder</type>

    <p>
    This supplier regulate macro recording of <member>XDispatch::dispatch()</member>
    calls. For that it capsulate a reference to a <type>DispatchRecorder</type>.
    Such recorder is used internaly and can be used externaly too.
    A supplier will be available on a <type>Frame</type> if recording was enabled,
    otherwise not. A frame supports a special property for that.
    This modular concept of recorder, supplier and frame makes it possible to
    implement local recording on one frame; global recording by using all currently
    opened frames or only some of them; and so on.
