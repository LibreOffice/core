/** is an abstract service for a component which offers a more complex user interface
    to users within a toolbar.

    <p>
    A generic toolbar function is represented as a button which has a state
    (enabled,disabled and selected, not selected). A toolbar controller can be added to a
    toolbar and provide information or functions within a more sophisticated user interface.<br/>
    A typical example for toolbar controller is the font chooser within the toolbar. It provides
    all available fonts in a dropdown box and shows the current chosen font.
