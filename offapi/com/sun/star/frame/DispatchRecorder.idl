/** provides functionality to record <member>XDispatch::dispatch()</member> requests

    <p>
    It records all necessary parameters of a call <member>XDispatch::dispatch()</member>
    and generate code which can be executed at later time to run same operations
    again. Which code will be generated depends from real implementation. So it's
    possible to generate e.g. Java/Basic or may Perl code.
    By using of a <type>DispatchRecorderSupplier</type>, which is available on
    a property of a <member>Frame::DispatchRecorderSupplier</member>, it's possible to change such code generation
    for further requests or disable it in general by setting this property to <NULL/>.
