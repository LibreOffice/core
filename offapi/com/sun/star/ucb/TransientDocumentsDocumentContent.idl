        <p>To create a new child of a TDCP Document:

        <ol>
        <li>
        Let the parent folder create a new content by calling
        XContentCreator::createNewContent() on it. The content
        type to use for new folders is "application/vnd.sun.star.tdoc-folder".
        To create a new stream, use the type string
        "application/vnd.sun.star.tdoc-stream".
        </li>
        <li>
        Set a title for the new folder/stream. (Let the new child execute the
        command "setPropertyValues"; pass a non-empty value for the property
        "Title").
        </li>
        <li>
        Let the new child ( not the parent! ) execute the command "insert".
        This will commit the creation process. For streams, you need to supply
        the implementation of an
        com::sun::star::io::XInputStream with the command's
        parameters, that provides access to the stream data.
