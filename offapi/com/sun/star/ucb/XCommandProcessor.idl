        necessary to obtain a new id for each command, because commands are
        executed synchronously. So the id for a command is valid again after a
        command previously associated with this id has finished. In fact you
        only should get one identifier per thread and assign it to every
        command executed by that thread.</p>

        <p>Also, after a call to XCommandProcessor::abort(), an
        identifier should not be used any longer (and instead be released by a
        call to XCommandProcessor2::releaseCommandIdentifier()),
        because it may well abort <em>all</em> further calls to
        XCommandProcessor::execute().</p>

        <p>To avoid ever-increasing resource consumption, the identifier
        should be released via
        XCommandProcessor2::releaseCommandIdentifier()

        is a unique id for the command. This identifier was obtained by calling

        XCommandProcessor, obtains exactly one identifier
        using XCommandProcessor::createCommandIdentifier().

        XCommandProcessor::execute() done by that thread.
