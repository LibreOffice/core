    /** A method used to propagate changes of a resultset.

        <p>In the first notify-call the listener gets two(!)
        <type>XResultSet</type>s and has to hold them. The
        <type>XResultSet</type>s are implementations of the service
        <type>ContentResultSet</type>.

        <p>The notified new <type>XResultSet</type> will stay valid after
        returning from this method. The old one will become invalid after
        returning.

        <p>While in notify-call the listener is allowed to read from old and
        new resultset, except in the first call, where only the new resultset
        is valid.

        <p>The Listener is allowed to stay (block) this call, until he really
        wants to use the new resultset. The only situation, where the listener
        has to return immediately is while he disposes his broadcaster or while
        he is removing himself as listener (otherwise you deadlock)!!!

        @param  Changes
        the changes to notify.
