        <p>In the first notify-call the listener gets two(!)
        <type scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XResultSet</type>s and has to hold
        them. The <type scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XResultSet</type>s are
        implementations of the service <type>ContentResultSet</type>.

        <p>The notified new
        <type scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XResultSet</type> will stay valid
        after returning from this method. The old one will become invalid after
        returning.

        <p>While in notify-call the listener is allowed to read from old and
        new result set, except in the first call, where only the new result set
        is valid.

        <p>The Listener is allowed to stay (block) this call, until he really
        wants to use the new result set. The only situation, where the listener
        has to return immediately is while he disposes his broadcaster or while
        he is removing himself as listener (otherwise you deadlock)!!!
