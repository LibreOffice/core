        A PCP Stream (<type>PackageStreamContent</type>) is a content which
        represents a file inside a package. It is always contained in a PCP
        Folder. A PCP Stream has no children.

        A PCP Folder (<type>PackageFolderContent</type>) is a container for
        other PCP Folders and PCP Streams.

        <p><b>URL Scheme for PCP Contents</b>
