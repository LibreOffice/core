                            "globalTransfer" at the UniversalContentBroker.
                            This command is able to transfer all kind of content
                            supported by that UCB.
                        </blockquote>
                        This command transfers (copies/moves) an object from one location
                        to another. It must be executed at the folder content representing
                        the <b>destination</b> of the transfer operation.<br>
                        Note that the implementation need not be able to handle
                        any type of contents.<br>
                        Generally, there are good chances that a transfer of a content will
                        succeed, if source and target folder have the same URL scheme.
                        But there is no guaranty for that.<br>
                        For instance, moving a message from a folder on IMAP server A
                        to a folder on IMAP server B may fail, because the transfer
                        command can't be implemented efficiently for this scenario,
                        because it is not directly supported by the IMAP protocol.
                        On the other hand, moving a message from one folder to
                        another folder on the same IMAP server should work, because it can
                        be implemeted efficiently.<br>
                        If an implementation is not able to handle a given source URL,
                        it should indicate this by issuing a
                        InteractiveBadTransferURLException interaction request.<br>
                        Source and target folder may be the same when doing a move operation.
                        <br>
                        Transfers without the transfer command can be done as follows:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create a new content at the target folder<br>
                            <code>targetContent = target.execute( "createNewContent", type )</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>Transfer data from source to target content<br>
                            <code>props = sourceContent.execute( "getPropertyValues", ... )</code>
                            <code>dataStream = sourceContent.execute( "open", ... )</code>
                            <code>targetContent.execute( "setPropertyValues", props )</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>Insert ( commit ) the new content<br>
                            <code>targetContent.execute( "insert", dataStream )</code>
                            </li>
                            <li>For move operations only: destroy the source content<br>
                            <code>sourceContent.execute( "delete", ... )</code>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>This mechanism should work for all transfer operations, but generally
                        it's less efficient than the transfer command.</p>
