        A HCP Root Folder can create HCP Folders and HCP Links. To create
        a new child of a HCP Root Folder:

        <ol>
        <li>
        Let the parent folder create a new content by calling
        XContentCreator::createNewContent() on it. The content
        type to use for new folders is "application/vnd.sun.star.hier-folder".
        To create a new link, use the type "application/vnd.sun.star.hier-link".
        </li>
        <li>
        Set a title at the new folder / link. ( Let the new child execute
        the command "setPropertyValues", which sets at least the property
        "Title" to a non-empty value ). For a link, you need to set the
        property "TargetURL" as well to a non-empty value.
        </li>
        <li>
        Let the new child ( not the parent! ) execute the command "insert".
        This will commit the creation process.
        </li>
        </ol>

        </p>
