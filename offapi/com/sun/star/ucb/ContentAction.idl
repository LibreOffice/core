/** specifies actions which can be transported with content events.

    The situations under which contents will send ContentEvents of the various
    action types are described below.  The description is broken into a list of
    useful definitions, a list of events that happen to contents, and a list of
    reactions taken by contents in response to those events.

    The definitions are as follows:

    D1  A content C has an identifier id(C).

    D2  A content C is in one of two states, Alive or Deleted.

    D3  A folder content F has a set of children H(F) that is a set of content
        identifiers.  (For example, an "open" command will usualy return a
        subset of the contents denoted by H(F).)

    The events that can happen to contents (and that are of interest in this
    context) are listed next.  Note that 'event' here does not mean an
    ContentEvent, but rather some event that occurs either because some content
    processes a command, or because a content gets informed about a relevant
    change in the underlying system it represents.

    E1  The identifier of a content C changes from id1(C) == A to id2(C) == B,
        denoted as

            E1(C: A->B).

        For example, this event may occur when content C processes a
        "setPropertyValues" command changing its "Title" propery, or when a
        folder that hierarchicaly contains C changes its identity.

    E2  The state of a content C changes from Alive to Deleted, denoted as

            E2(C).

        For example, this event may occur when content C processes a "delete"
        command, or when a content representing an IMAP message gets informed
        by the IMAP server that the message has been deleted.

    E3  The set of children of a folder content F is enlarged by some
        identifier A (that was not previously in that set, i.e.,
        !(A in H1(F)) && (A in H2(F))), denoted as

            E3(F, A).

        For example, this event may occur when a new content created at
        folder F processes its "insert" command, or when a folder representing
        an IMAP mailbox gets informed by the IMAP server that a new message has
        arrived at that mailbox.

    Finally, the list of reactions taken by contents in response to the above
    events gives a description of what kinds of ContentEvents are sent in which
    situations:

    R1  E1(C: A->B)  results in C sending an EXCHANGED ContentEvent,
        which then results in the following:  All folders F that used to have A
        as a child, but will not have B as a child, i.e.,

            (A in H1(F)) && !(B in H2(F)),

        send a REMOVED ContentEvent.

    R2  E2(C)  results in C sending a DELETED ContentEvent,
        which then results in the following:  All folders F that used to have A
        as a child, but will not continue to have A as a child, i.e.,

            (A in H1(F)) && !(A in H2(F)),

        send a REMOVED event.

    R3  E3(F, A)  results in F sending an INSERTED event.
