/** provides read access to a fragment of the hierarchy data.

    <p>A hierarchy data source provides access to a tree of hierarchy data
    nodes. Each hierarchy data node, except the root node, has a parent that
    is a hierarchy data node too. A hierarchy data node has a name.

    <p>Each hierarchy data node has three data members:

    <ul>
    <li>"Title", which is of type <atom>string</atom>. It contains a title
    for the node. This value must not be empty.
    <li>"TargetURL", which is of type <atom>string</atom></li> It may contain
    any URL, which will be treated as the target of a hierarchy link.
    <li>"Children", which is of type <type>HierarchyDataReadAccess</type> or
    of type <type>HierarchyDataReadWriteAccess</type></li>, depending on the
    type of the node. This member provides access to the children of a node.
    </ul>
