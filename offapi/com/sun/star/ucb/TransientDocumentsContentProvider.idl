/** The Transient Documents Content Provider (TDCP) implements a
    <type>ContentProvider</type> for the <type>UniversalContentBroker</type>
    (UCB).

    <p>It provides access to the hierachical structure of the documents that
    are active in a running OpenOffice.org process. As long as a document was
    not closed, the TDCP can access it. All documents that have been loaded -
    regardless of their persistent document format (sxw, doc, sxc, xls, ...)
    or that have been created  but not yet saved to any storage medium, are
    supported. The TDCP is not able to load any documents itself. This is
    exclusively done by the OpenOffice.org document handling framework. The
    document contents provided by the TDCP represent live data, which may
    differ from any persistent representation of the document, for instance,
    because the user modified the document after loading, but did not yet save
    it.

    /** provides four different types of contents: Stream, Folder, Document and
        Root.

        <p>

        <b>TDCP Contents</b>
        <ol>
        <li>
        A TDCP Stream (<type>TransientDocumentsStreamContent</type>) is a
        content which represents a data stream of an Office document. It is
        contained in a TDCP Folder or TDCP Document. A TDCP Stream has no
        children.
        </li>
        <li>
        A TDCP Folder (<type>TransientDocumentsFolderContent</type>) is a
        container for other TDCP Folders and TDCP Streams. It may be contained
        in another TDCP Folder or in a TDCP Document.
        </li>
        <li>
        A TDCP Document (<type>TransientDocumentsDocumentContent</type>)
        represents the root folder of a transient document. It is a container
        for other TDCP Folders and TDCP Streams. It is always a child of the
        TDCP Root.
        </li>
        <li>
        There is at most one instance of a TDCP Root
        (<type>TransientDocumentsRootContent</type>) at a time. All other TDCP
        contents are children of this folder. The TDCP Root Folder can contain
        only TDCP Documents. It has the fixed URL "vnd.sun.star.tdoc:/".
        </li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>URL Scheme for TDCP Contents</b>

        <p>Each TDCP content has an identifier corresponding to the following
        scheme:

        <ul>
        <li>
        tdcp-URL   = "vnd.sun.star.tdoc:" abs-path
        </li>
        <li>
        abs-path   = +( "/" segment )
        </li>
        <li>
        segment    = *( pchar )
        </li>
        <li>
        pchar      = unreserved | escaped | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" | "$" | ","
        </li>
        <li>
        unreserved = alphanum | mark
        </li>
        <li>
        mark       = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | "("  | ")"
        </li>
        <li>
        escaped    = "%" hex hex
        </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Examples:

        <ul>
        <li>
        vnd.sun.star.tdoc:/
        ( The TDCP Root  )
        </li>
        <li>
        vnd.sun.star.tdoc:/22
        ( The document with the id 22 )
        </li>
        <li>
        vnd.sun.star.tdoc:/22/
        ( The document with the id 22 )
        </li>
        <li>
        vnd.sun.star.tdoc:/42/folder/subfolder
        ( The folder/stream named subfolder contained in folder named folder,
        which is contained in the document with the id 42 )
        </li>
        </ul>

        </p>
