        <p>An object representing a directory in the file system is able
        to create a new object, which in turn can become the representation
        of a physical file/directory being contained in the initial directory.
        The precise way is the following:

        <p>

        <ol>
        <li>
        Let the parent folder create a new content by calling
        XContentCreator::createNewContent() on it. The content
        type to use for new directories is
        "application/vnd.sun.staroffice.ftp-folder". To create a new file
        use the type "application/vnd.sun.staroffice.ftp-file".
        As return value you get a new file content object.
        </li>
        <li>
        Set a title at the new object by letting it execute
        the command "setPropertyValues", which sets at least the property
        "Title" to a non-empty value ).
        </li>
        <li>
        Let the new object ( not the parent! ) execute the command "insert".
        This will create the corresponding physical file or directory.
        For files, you need to supply the implementation of
        an com::sun::star::io::XInputStream with the
        command's parameters, that provides access to the stream data.
        </li>
        </ol>
