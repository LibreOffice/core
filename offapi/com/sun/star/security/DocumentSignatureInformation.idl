        This value can be ignored when this struct is returned as part of
        a macro signature validation.
        As of OpenOffice.org 3.2 and ODF 1.2 the document signature comprises
        all files except the signature file itself.
        Signatures in OOo 2.x were only
        applied to the files in the root of the document, except mimetype, the
        Pictures and ObjectReplacements/Objects folder. That is, macros
        were not part of the document signature.
        OOo 3.0 signed everything, except mimetype and the META-INF folder.
        <p>
        If PartialDocumentSignature is true, then the signature was created by OOo
        with a version less then 3.2. In this case, not all files are signed. The
        signature can still be regarded as valid, as long as SignatureIsValid is true
        and the certificate could be validated. However, users should be notified about
        the fact, that not everything in this document is signed.
