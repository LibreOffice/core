    Calendar items as returned in a sequence by

    <p> Similar to
    <type scope="::com::sun::star::i18n">Calendar</type> this provides 
    additional members with a sequence of possessive (genitive case) and 
    partitive case month names for locales that use them, for example 
    Slavic locales. If a locale does not provide the possessive form in 
    <member>GenitiveMonths</member>, the names are identical to the 
    nominative case nouns in <member>Calendar::Months</member>. If a 
    locale does not provide the partitive case in 
    <member>PartitiveMonths</member>, the names are identical to 
    <member>GenititiveMonths</member>. </p>

    <p> The sequences are of type
    <type scope="com::sun::star::i18n">CalendarItem2</type> instead of
    <type scope="com::sun::star::i18n">CalendarItem</type>, with the 
    additional <member>NarrowName</member> member.
