        locale's calendar. It is not predictable if the string will be
        numeric or a name, or if in case it returns a numeric string
        how many digits that will have. For example, a short year
        display string will normally be two digits with a Gregorian

            This argument designates the basic transliteration mode as

            on the locale, different conversions for year and month, for
            example, may be chosen internally. This is beyond the user's
            control and depends on locale specific conventions of how a
            date is assembled.
