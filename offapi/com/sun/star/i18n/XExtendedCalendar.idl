    This interface provides access to locale specific calendar

    set at the calendar. </p>

        Returns a string (number or name to display) matching the
        given code constant.

        <p> Note that the string returned depends completely on the
        locale's calendar. It is not predictable if the string will be
        numeric or a name, or if in case it retuns a numeric string
        how many digits that will have. For example, a short year
        display string will normally be two digits with a Gregorian
        calendar, but with a Jewish calendar it will have three
        digits. <p/>

            This argument designates the basic transliteration mode as
            if specified for the year representation. However, depending
            on the locale, different conversions for year and month, for
            example, may be chosen internally. This is beyond the user's
            control and depends on locale specific conventions of how a
            date is assembled.
