        <ul>
            <li>The parent returned by <type>getAccessibleParent</type>
                is the accessible page preview of a text document.
                That is, the object returned by
                <type>getAccessibleContext</type> supports
                <type>com.sun.star.text.AccessibleTextDocumentPageView</type>.
            <li>The children returned by <type>getAccessibleChild</type> all
                support the interface XAccessible. Calling
                <type>getAccessibleContext</type> for these children returns
                an object that supports one of the following services.

                        A paragraph fragment is the part of a paragraph that

                <p>The following rules apply to the children order:
                <ul>
                    <li>The logical order of paragraph and table fragments is
                        never changed.
                    <li>Headers appear immediately before the first paragraph or
                        table fragment of the header's page.
                    <li>Footnotes appear immediately after the last paragraph or
                        table fragment of the footnote's page. The logical order
                        of footnotes isn't changed.
                    <li>Endnotes appear immediately after the last footnote of
                        the endnote's page or after the last paragraph or
                        table fragment of this page if there are no footnotes.
                        The logical order of endnotes isn't changed.

                        footnote, paragraph or table fragment of the footer's
                        page.
                    <li>Text frames, graphics, embedded objects and shapes that
                        are painted in the background appear before any other
                        children. Their order reflects the z order.
                    <li>Text frames, graphics, embedded objects and shapes
                        that are painted in the foreground appear behind any
                           other children. Their order reflects the z order,
                        with the exception of controls that appear really last,
                        but also keep the z order.
                </ul>
            <li>The role is <type>PANEL</type>
            <li>The name is "page" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with a number appended.
            <li>The description is "page" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with the page number or
                character appended in the format that is specified in the
                page style.
            <li>There are no relations.</em>
            <li>The following states might be contained in the state set
                returned by <type>getAccessibleStateSet</type>:
                <ul>
                    <li><type>DEFUNC</type> (indicates that the document
                        window has been closed or the endnote is
                        not existing any longer)
                    <li><type>ENABLED</type> (always contained)
                    <li><type>OPAQUE</type>
