                <method scope="::com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >XAccessibleContext::getAccessibleParent</method>
                is either the accessible view of a text document,
                a page of the accessible page preview of a text document,
                or the accessible page preview of a spreadsheet document.
            <li>The children returned by
                <method scope="::com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >XAccessibleContext::getAccessibleChild</method> all

                an object that supports one of the following services.

                        represents a whole paragraph (and not a fragment only),
                        because there are no page breaks within headers and
                        footers.

                        and is at least partially visible. The child always

                >AccessibleRole::FOOTER</const>.
            <li>The name is "header" or "footer" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with a number appended.
            <li>The description is "header" or "footer" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with the page number appended in
                the format that is specified in the page's style.
