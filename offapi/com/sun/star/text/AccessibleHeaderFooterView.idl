                >XAccessibleContext::getAccessibleParent</method>
                is either the accessible view of a text document,
                a page of the accessible page preview of a text document,
                or the accessible page preview of a spreadsheet document.

                        because there are no page breaks within headers and
                        footers.

            <li>The name is "header" or "footer" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with a number appended.
            <li>The description is "header" or "footer" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with the page number appended in
                the format that is specified in the page's style.
