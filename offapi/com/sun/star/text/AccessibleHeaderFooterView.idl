    /** This interface gives access to any paragraph and table that is
          contained in the header and footer and is at least partially visible
        on the screen.

        <ul>
            <li>The parent returned by <type>getAccessibleParent</type>
                is either the accessible view of a text document,
                a page of the accessible page preview of a text document,
                or the accessible page preview of a spreadsheet document.
            <li>The children returned by <type>getAccessibleChild</type> all
                support the interface XAccessible. Calling
                <type>getAccessibleContext</type> for these children returns
                an object that supports one of the following services.
                <ul>
                    <li><type>com.sun.star.text.AccessibleParagraphView</type>:
                        A child of this kind is returned for every paragraph
                        that is contained in the document body and
                        is at least partially visible. The child always
                        represents a whole paragarph (and not a fragment only),
                        because there are no page breaks within headers and
                        footers.
                    <li><type>com.sun.star.table.AccessibleTableView</type>:
                        A child of this kind is returned for every table
                        that is contained in the document body
                        and is at least partially visible. The child always
                        represents a whole table (and not a fragment only),
                        because there are no page breaks within headers and
                        footers.
                </ul>
            <p>The logical order of paragraphs and tables is never changed.
            <li>The role is either <type>HEADER</type> or <type>FOOTER</type>.
            <li>The name is "header" or "footer" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with a number appended.
            <li>The description is "header" or "footer" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with the page number appended in
                the format that is specified in the page's style.
            <li>There are no relations.
            <li>The following states might be contained in the state set
                returned by <type>getAccessibleStateSet</type>:
                <ul>
                    <li><type>DEFUNC</type> (indicates that the document
                        window has been closed or the header or footer is
                        not existing any longer)
                    <li><type>EDITABLE</type>
                    <li><type>ENABLED</type> (always contained)
                    <li><type>OPAQUE</type>
                    <li><type>SHOWING</type>
                    <li><type>VISIBLE</type>
                </ul>
            <li>Depending of the application's region setting, the locale is
                the western, asian or complex default language of the document.
