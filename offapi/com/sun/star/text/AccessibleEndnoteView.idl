    /** This interface gives access to any paragraph fragment and table
        fragment that is contained in a endnote and is at least
        partially visible on the screen.

        <ul>
            <li>The parent returned by <type>getAccessibleParent</type>
                is either the accessible view of a text document,
                a page of the accessible page preview of a text document,
                or the accessible page preview of a spreadsheet document.
            <li>The children returned by <type>getAccessibleChild</type> all
                support the interface XAccessible. Calling
                <type>getAccessibleContext</type> for these children returns
                an object that supports one of the following services.
                <ul>
                    <li><type>com.sun.star.text.AccessibleParagraphView</type>:
                        A child of this kind is returned for every paragraph
                        fragment that is contained in the document body and
                        is at least partially visible. A paragraph fragment is
                        the part of a paragraph that is displayed on a
                        certain page.
                    <li><type>com.sun.star.table.AccessibleTableView</type>:
                        A child of this kind is returned for every table
                        fragment that is contained in the document body
                        and is at least partially visible. A table fragment is
                        the part of a table that is displayed on a certain page.
                </ul>
                <p>The logical order of paragraph and table fragments is never
                   changed.
            <li>The role is <type>ENDNOTE</type>
            <li>The name is "endnote" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with a number appended.
            <li>The description is endnote" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with the endnote number or
                character appended in the format that is specified in the
                endnote settings.
            <li>There are no relations. <em>TODO: One might specify a relation
                to the endnote anchor's paragraph.</em>
            <li>The following states might be contained in the state set
                returned by <type>getAccessibleStateSet</type>:
                <ul>
                    <li><type>DEFUNC</type> (indicates that the document
                        window has been closed or the endnote is
                        not existing any longer)
                    <li><type>EDITABLE</type>
                    <li><type>ENABLED</type> (always contained)
