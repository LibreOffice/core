        <p>If set, the frame follows the text flow and doesn't leaves the layout
        environment, which is given by its anchor, above and below.
        E.g.: Anchor resides in the document body then the frame doesn't leave
        the document body above and below and follows the text flow through
        the document bodies of the different pages.

        If not set, the frame doesn't follow the text flow and stays on the page,
        on which its anchor is found, but it may leave the layout environment,
        which is given by its anchor.
        E.g.: Anchor resides in the document body then the frame stays on page,
        where this document body is, but it could leave the document body above
        and below, e.g. overlapping with the page header.

        Note: The areas for the vertical orientation relation at page areas are
        interpreted in dependence to this property (@see BaseFrameProperties.VertOrientRelation).
        If property is set, the page area is interpreted as the layout environment,
        given by its anchor. E.g.: Anchor resides in the page header then the
        page header determines the page area. If property isn't set, the page area is
        determined by the document page, the anchor is on. E.g.: Anchor resides
        in the page header then the document page, the page header is on, determines
        the page area.
        An exception of this interpretation rule is applied, if the anchor resides
        in a table cell. In this situation the page area is always determined by
        the table cell.</p>
