                        the part of a paragraph that is displayed on a

                        fragment that is contained in the document body
                        and is at least partially visible. A table fragment is
                        the part of a table that is displayed on a certain page.

                        kind is returned for every text frame that is at
                        least partially visible. These objects are children

                        is at least partially visible. These objects are
                        children of the <type>AccessibleTextDocumentView</type>

                        are text frames that are bound as character. They are
                        children of the paragraph they are contained in.

                        >AccessibleTextEmbeddedObject</type>:
                        A child of this kind is returned for every embedded
                        object that is at least partially visible.
                        These objects are children of the
                        <type>AccessibleTextDocumentView</type> regardless
                        whether they are bound to a page, a paragraph, a frame,

                        derived interface) is returned for every shape that
                        is at least partially visible. These objects are
                        children of the
                        <type>AccessibleTextDocumentView</type> regardless
                        whether they are bound to a page, a paragraph, a
                        frame or a character.
                </ul>
                <p>The following rules apply to the children order:
                <ul>
                    <li>The logical order of paragraph and table fragments is
                        never changed.
                    <li>Headers appear immediately before the first paragraph or
                        table fragment of the header's page.
                    <li>Footnotes appear immediately after the last paragraph or
                        table fragment of the footnote's page. The logical order
                        of footnotes isn't changed.
                    <li>Endnotes appear immediately after the last footnote of
                        the endnote's page or after the last paragraph or
                        table fragment of this page if there are no footnotes.
                        The logical order of endnotes isn't changed.
                    <li>Footers appear immediately after the last endnote,
                        footnote, paragraph or table fragment of the footer's
                        page.
                    <li>Text frames, graphics, embedded objects and shapes that
                        are painted in the background appear before any other
                        children. Their order reflects the z order.
                    <li>Text frames, graphics, embedded objects and shapes
                        that are painted in the foreground appear behind any
                           other children. Their order reflects the z order,
                        with the exception of controls that appear really last,
                        but also keep the z order.
                </ul>

                in application's language).
