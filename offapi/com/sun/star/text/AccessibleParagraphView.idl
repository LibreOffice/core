          partially visible on the screen. A paragraph fragment is the portion
        of a paragraph that is displayed on a single page or a in a single
        column.

        <ul>
            <li>The parent returned by
                <method scope="::com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >XAccessibleContext::getAccessibleParent</method> is the
                accessible view of a text document (in this case the
                paragraph is contained in a page body) or the accessible
                view of a header, footer, footnote, endnote, table cell,
                text frame, page or shape.</li>
            <li>The children returned by
                <method scope="::com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >XAccessibleContext::getAccessibleChild</method> are the
                graphics, text boxes and OLE objects that are bound
                <em>as</em> character within the paragraph. Graphics, text
                boxes and OLE objects that are bound to the paragraph or
                <em>to</em> a character within the paragraph are not
                children of the paragraph fragment but of the document view

                if the paragraph's style is contained in the chapter
                numbering of a text document.
            <li>The name is "paragraph" or "heading" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with a number appended.
            <li>The description contains the term "paragraph" (or the equivalent
                term in application's language) and the first sentence of
                the paragraph.
            <li>There are no relations.
