    /** This interface gives access to a paragraph fragment that is at least
          partially visible on the screen. A paragraph fragment is the portion
        of a paragraph that is displayed on a single page or a in a single
        column.

        <ul>
            <li>The parent returned by <type>getAccessibleParent</type>
                is the accessible view of a text document (in this case the
                paragraph is contained in a page body) or the accessible view
                of a header, footer, footnote, endnote, table cell, text frame,
                page or shape.
            <li>The children returned by <type>getAccessibleChild</type> are
                the graphics, text boxes and OLE objects that are bound <em>as</em>
                character within the paragraph. Graphics, text boxes and OLE
                objects that are bound to the paragraph or <em>to</em> a character
                within the paragraph are not children of the paragraph
                fragment but of the document view itself.
            <li>The role is either <type>PARAGRAPH</type> or
                <type>HEADING</type>. The later one is returned if the
                paragraph's style is contained in the chapter numbering
                of a text document.
            <li>The name is "paragraph" or "heading" (or the equivalent term
                in application's language) with a number appended.
            <li>The description contains the term "paragraph" (or the equivalent
                term in application's language) and the first sentence of
                the paragraph.
            <li>There are no relations.
            <li>The following states are supported by the
                <type>XAccessibleStateSet</type> returned by
                <type>getAccessibleStateSet</type>.
                <ul>
                    <li><type>DEFUNC</type> (indicates that the document
                        window has been closed or the paragraph fragment is
                        not existing any longer).
                    <li><type>EDITABLE</type>
                    <li><type>ENABLED</type> (always contained)
                    <li><type>MULTILINE</type> (always contained)
                    <li><type>MULTISELECTABLE</type> (always contained)
                    <li><type>OPAQUE</type>
                    <li><type>SHOWING</type>
                    <li><type>VISIBLE</type>
                    <li><type>FOCUSED</type>
                </ul>
            <li>Depending of the application's region setting, the locale is
                the western, asian or complex language of the paragraph.
