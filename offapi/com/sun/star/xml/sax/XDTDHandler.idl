/** receives events according to the DTD of the document.

    <p>The SAX parser may report these events in any order, regardless of the
    order in which the notations and unparsed entities were declared; however,
    all DTD events must be reported after the document handler's
    <code>startDocument</code> event, and before the first <code>startElement</code>
    event.  It is up to the application to store the information for future
    use (perhaps in a hash table or object tree). If the application encounters
    attributes of type "NOTATION", "ENTITY", or "ENTITIES", it can use the
    information that it obtained through this interface to find the entity
    and/or notation that corresponds with the attribute value.
