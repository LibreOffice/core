 * Defines priority for the element mark's notification.
 * <p>
 * The PRI_MINIMUM priority is a value less than any practical
 * priority value, it is used when compare between different
 * priority values.
 * <p>
 * The PRI_AFTERMODIFY priority represents the notification will be
 * sent after any internal modification has finished.
 * <p>
 * The PRI_BEFOREMODIFY proirity represents the notification will be
 * sent before any internal modification happens.
 * <p>
 * So an element mark with PRI_BEFOREMODIFY will be handled first,
 * and one with PRI_AFTERMODIFY will be handled at last.
