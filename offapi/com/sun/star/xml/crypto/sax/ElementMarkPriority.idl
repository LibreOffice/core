 * priority value, it is used when compare between different
 * priority values.

 * The PRI_AFTERMODIFY priority represents the notification will be
 * sent after any internal modification has finished.

 * The PRI_BEFOREMODIFY proirity represents the notification will be
 * sent before any internal modification happens.
