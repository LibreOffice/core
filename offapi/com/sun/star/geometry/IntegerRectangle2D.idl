/*  Removed, because XCanvas is private API until further notice.

    The values are stored as integers. Please note that the
    com.sun.star.rendering.XCanvas defines the
    screen representation of rectangles in such a way that the lower
    and the rightmost line of the rectangle are not drawn on
    screen. Thus, if for two rectangles R1 and R2, R1.x2 equals R2.x1,
    the screen representation of these rectangles will not overlap,
    but being exactly adjacent. That also means, that an
    IntegerRectangle2D with X1 equal X2 or Y1 equal Y2 can be
    considered empty.<p>
