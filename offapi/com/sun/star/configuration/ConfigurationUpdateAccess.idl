 or inserting and removing elements.

 <p>Descendants of this service also implement this service
 unless they are marked <em>read-only</em> (which is indicated by attribute
 <const scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyAttribute::READONLY</const>),
 in which case they only need implement <type>ConfigurationAccess</type>.
 </p>

 <p>The classification of implementations that is described for
 <type>ConfigurationAccess</type> applies to implementations of this service
 as well. Therefore an implementation will support one of several alternate
 services describing its <em>Container</em> role and one of several alternate
 services describing its <em>Element</em> role. These services are
 extensions of the respective services documented for <type>ConfigurationAccess</type>.
 </p>
 <ul>
    <li><em>Container</em> role:
        A <em>group</em> permits changing child values.
        A <em>set</em> permits inserting and removing contained elements.
    </li>
    <li><em>Element</em> role:
        The root element of a modifiable tree provides extended functionality
        to control processing of changes for the entire tree (fragment) by
        supporting <type scope="com::sun::star::util">XChangesBatch</type>.
        For elements of a <em>set</em> or a <em>group</em> no additional
        interfaces are supported.
    </li>

     Implementations shall therefore implement one of <type>SetUpdate</type> or
     <type>GroupUpdate</type> depending on the <em>Container</em> role.
