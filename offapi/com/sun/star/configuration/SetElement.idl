/** provides information about a dynamic element that can be inserted into a
 homogeneous set of elements within a hierarchy.

 <p>Provides information about the element.
 Provides access to its containing set object.
 Allows controlling the lifetime of the element.
 </p>

 <p>Set elements may be added to and removed from the hierarchy at runtime.
 They bear user-defined names. They may exist independently, outside any
 container.
 </p>

 <p>New set element instances generally are created through members of
 <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XSingleServiceFactory</type> or,
 if supported, <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiServiceFactory</type>
 on an implementation of <type>SetUpdate</type>. Initially, they are not
 contained in a set object and have no meaningful name.
 </p>

 <p>While an instance is not contained in a set object, it is owned by
 the client and can be disposed by calling
 <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XComponent::dispose()</member>. The name
 of the object can freely be changed in that situation though without
 persistent effect.
 </p>

 <p>When the instance is inserted into a set (this includes replacing an
 existing element), ownership is transferred to the container.
 While it is contained in the container, clients must not dispose the
 object. When inserted, the name of the object is fixed and is used to
 identify it within the container. An implementation may support
 <member scope="com::sun::star::container">XNamed::setName()</member> even in
 this case. If it does, changing the name has the same effect of removing
 the object (under the old name) and then reinserting it into the same
 container (using the new name).
 </p>

 <p>When an instance is removed from a set (this includes being replaced by
 a new element), ownership is transferred to the client again. It can then be
 disposed or reinserted into a container. An instance can only be inserted
 into a container, if it was obtained from the same hierarchy.
 </p>

 <p>When a set element is removed from its set from outside the hierarchy, the
 container disposes of the object. This occurrence can be detected by registering
 a <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XEventListener</type> with the object.
 </p>

 <p>If an implementation is part of a <em>read-only</em> view of the hierarchy,
 changing the name or parent is not supported (the object can't be removed from
 its container anyway).
 </p>

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::SetAccess
    Parent objects of this service generally implement service SetAccess.

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::GroupElement
    A complementary service for elements of a static heterogeneous collection.

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::AccessRootElement

 </p>

 <p>An implementation may also support
 <member scope="com::sun::star::container">XChild::setParent()</member>.
 If it does, changing the parent has the effect of first removing the object
 from its old parent (if any) and then inserting it into the new parent
 (unless that is <NULL/>) under the same name. The new parent must be part of
 the same hierarchy as the old one. The name of the object must have been set
 before.
