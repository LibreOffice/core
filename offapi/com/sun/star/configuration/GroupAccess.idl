 trees as part of a (by name) hierarchy.

 <!-- Dennis: Could this also read as "...as part of an alphabetical hierarchy." ? -->

 <p>Provides access to, and information about, its children and descendants
 viewed either as properties or as contained elements.
 </p>

 <p><em>Groups</em> are static collections within the hierarchy.</p>

 <p>The number and names of contained elements are fixed in advance
 and each child may have a different type.
 </p>

 <p>This service subsumes two alternate ways of accessing child and descendent
 elements. These strongly overlap, supporting the basic identity
 <code>xGroup.getPropertyValue( aName ) == xGroup.getByName( aName )</code>.
 </p>

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::GroupElement
    Child objects of this service generally implement service GroupElement.

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::SetAccess
    A complementary service providing for dynamic homogeneous sets of elements.

/** is the basic service for accessing child and descendent nodes using
 a view of the tree as a hierarchy of properties and subproperties.

 <p>This view is meaningful only for a static fragment of the hierarchy
 Objects' properties may change, but not which properties they have.
 Therefore, dynamic elements of the hierarchy (see <type>SetAccess</type>)
 do not implement service <type>PropertyHierarchy</type>.
 </p>

 <p>If such elements occur as properties or subproperties of an implementation,
 it is not specified whether direct subproperty access using
 <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">XHierarchicalPropertySet</type> or
 <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">XMultiHierarchicalPropertySet</type> can
 be used to access descendants of such elements.
 </p>

 <p>Similarly, information about such descendants may not be available from
 the <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">XHierarchicalPropertySetInfo</type>
 the implementation provides.
 </p>

 <p>If an implementation is part of a <em>read-only</em> view of the hierarchy,
 all properties and subproperties will be reported as having attribute
 <const scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyAttribute::READONLY</const> set,
 and attempts to change property values will fail.
