 <p>Provides information about the element and the whole hierarchy.
 Allows controlling the lifetime of the hierarchy.
 Allows observing changes in the hierarchy as a whole.
 </p>

 <p>When access to a hierarchy is first obtained from a factory or provider,
 this is the initial object that is created by the factory.
 It represents the <em>root</em> of the accessible part of the hierarchy.
 </p>

 <p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong> In this description "hierarchy" may actually
 designate a part or fragment of a larger hierarchy. It is that part that is
 rooted in the element represented by an implementation of this service
 and that is accessible starting from this element.</em>
 </p>

 <p>Generally it is not possible to navigate the parent or siblings, if any,
 of this element, so <type scope="com::sun::star::container">XChild</type> is
 not supported.
 </p>

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::UpdateRootElement
    Implementations that support modifying data in the hierarchy
    implement service UpdateRootElement.

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::SetElement
    A complementary service, for children of a dynamic homogeneous container.

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::GroupElement
    A complementary service, for children of a static heterogeneous collection.

 @see com::sun::star::configuration::ConfigurationProvider

 <p>The owner of the hierarchy may dispose of this object
 using <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XComponent::dispose()</member>.
 As this object owns its child elements and, recursively, the whole hierarchy,
 any descendant elements obtained, directly or indirectly, from this object
 will also be disposed. Disposing of the object does not affect a persistent
 representation of the hierarchy.
 </p>

 <p>When an implementation is obtained from a factory or provider, ownership
 of it is usually transferred to the client. See the documentation
 of the particular provider or factory service for details.
 </p>

 <p>The provider of this object may still dispose of this object, when the
 lifetime of the provider ends or if these objects represent
 the root of only a fragment of an enclosing hierarchy and
 this fragment is removed from the complete hierarchy by an outside source.
 </p>

 <p>Clients may register an <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XEventListener</type>
 to be notified when the object is disposed for either cause.

 <p>A client can register an
 <type scope="com::sun::star::util">XChangesListener</type>,

 hierarchy (fragment) this object represents.
 </p>

 <p>An implementation will collect as many changes as possible into a single

 </p>

 <p>
 If <member scope="com::sun::star::beans">XMultiPropertySet::setPropertyValues()</member>
 or <member scope="com::sun::star::beans">XMultiHierarchicalPropertySet::setHierarchicalPropertyValues()</member>
 is used on an element of the hierarchy to change multiple values within
 the hierarchy, all changes will be notified with a single event.
 </p>

 <p>If an outside source uses
 <member scope="com::sun::star::util">XChangesBatch::commitChanges()</member>
 on an overlapping hierarchy access, all relevant changes will be notified
 with a single event.
 </p>

 locale-dependent data in the hierarchy or if the (partial) hierarchy rooted
 in this object does not contain any locale-dependent elements.
 </p>

 <p><em>Changing the locale is generally not supported.</em> If it is supported,
 there is no guarantee that values already loaded into the hierarchy, or an
 application cache, are refreshed to reflect the new locale. Use of
 <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XLocalizable::setLocale()</member>
