/** This is implemented by objects that are instances of a named template.

    <p> Template names are similar service names, but apply to structure and
        content, rather than to type.
    </p>
    <p> Often a template description can be retrieved from a repository, and be then
        interpreted by a factory object, so templates provide a means to build
        new kinds of objects dynamically.
