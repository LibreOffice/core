 <p>Changes can be observed by registering a listener with interface
 <type scope="com::sun::star::container">XContainer</type>.
 </p>

 <p>If the elements of this set are of object type, new elements are constructed
 to match the tree structure prescribed by the element template of this set, when
 using interfaces <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XSingleServiceFactory</type>
 and (if supported) <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiServiceFactory</type>.

 <p>Objects that are removed from a set can be reinserted into any set supporting
 the same template within the same hierarchy. Even under a different name.
 </p>

 <p>Implementations that support insertion of objects that weren't obtained
 from within the hierarchy must reject elements that don't have the correct
 structure as described by the template, even if the object returns the
 correct template name from <member>XTemplateInstance::getTemplateName()</member>.
 </p>

 <p>Other ways in which an element may be moved among or within compatible sets
 include <member scope="com::sun::star::container">XChild::setParent()</member>
 and <member scope="com::sun::star::container">XNamed::setName()</member>, if
 the element implements them.
