/** An interaction request handler that lets the user handle a number of well
    known requests via GUI dialogs.

    <P>The well known requests handled by this service include
    <UL>
        <LI><type>MergeRecoveryRequest</type>*</LI>
    </UL>
    The requests marked with an asterisk are only handled if (a) their
    continuations match certain restrictions (see below), and (b) the
    necessary resource strings are available (this can be exploited by
    applications that carry only a subset of all resource files with
    them).</P>

    <P>The continuation restrictions are as follows:  Let <VAR>C</VAR> be the
    subset of the provided continuations that are of type
    <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionApprove</type>,
    <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionDisapprove</type>,
    <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionRetry</type>, or
    <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionAbort</type> (or of a
    derived type).  All other continuations are ignored for these requests.
    The request is only handled if the set <VAR>C</VAR> is any of the
    following:
    <UL>
        <LI>Abort</LI>
        <LI>Retry, Abort</LI>
        <LI>Approve</LI>
        <LI>Approve, Abort</LI>
        <LI>Approve, Disapprove</LI>
        <LI>Approve, Disapprove, Abort</LI>
    </UL></P>
