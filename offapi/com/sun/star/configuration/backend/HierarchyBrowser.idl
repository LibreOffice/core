        <p> The repository to browse is selected by arguments passed to
            com::sun::star::task::XJob::execute().
            The names and meanings of such arguments depend on
            the implementation. Each implementation must document such arguments.

        <p> The following argument to
            com::sun::star::task::XJob::execute()
            must be supported by all implementations:
        <dl>
            <dt><code>ExcludeComponents</code> : `string[]` or `string`</dt>
            <dd>A component or list of components that should be skipped
                and excluded from the result. If this argument appears multiple
                times it is handled cumulatively.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        </p>
        <p> The return value of
            com::sun::star::task::XJob::execute()
            is a list of components found. The format in which components are
            returned may depend on the implementation. Each implementation
            should support returning component identifiers that are compatible
            with some implementation of Backend.
