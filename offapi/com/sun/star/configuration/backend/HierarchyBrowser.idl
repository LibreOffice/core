        <p> The repository to browse is selected by arguments passed to
            <member scope="com::sun::star::task">XJob::execute()</member>.
            The names and meanings of such arguments depend on
            the implementation. Each implementation must document such arguments.

        <p> The following argument to
            <member scope="com::sun::star::task">XJob::execute()</member>
            must be supported by all implementations:
        <dl>
            <dt><code>ExcludeComponents</code> : <atom dim="[]">string</atom> or <atom >string</atom></dt>
            <dd>A component or list of components that should be skipped
                and excluded from the result. If this argument appears multiple
                times it is handled cumulatively.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        </p>
        <p> The return value of
            <member scope="com::sun::star::task">XJob::execute()</member>
            is a list of components found. The format in which components are
            returned may depend on the implementation. Each implementation
            should support returning component identifiers that are compatible
            with some implementation of <type>Backend</type>.
