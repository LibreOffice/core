/*  provides access to a configuration tree as a registry.

    <p>This service is deprecated,
    com.sun.star.configuration::ConfigurationProvider should
    be used instead.</p>

    <p> Using the com::sun::star::registry::XSimpleRegistry
    interface, the service can be bound to a subtree within the
    configuration tree, as provided by an
    com.sun.star.configuration::ConfigurationProvider
    service, which must be accessible from the service factory you use for the
    creation of this service.
    </p>
    <p> There are some restrictions when accessing a configuration tree using a registry.
    Most of them are implications of the fact that a configuration tree is very static in
    it's structure. Removal and addition of sub nodes is allowed only for special
    nodes, and even then the new elements have to comply to a given scheme (which is some
    kind of attribute of the container node). So for instance the
    com.sun.star.registry::XRegistryKey::createKey() method is not allowed
    for some nodes.
    </p><p>
    Thus anybody using this service is strongly advised to read and understand the specification
    of an configuration provider (com.sun.star.configuration::ConfigurationProvider)
    and all of its aspects.
    </p>
