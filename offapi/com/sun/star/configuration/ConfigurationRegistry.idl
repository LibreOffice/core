/*  provides access to a configuration tree as a registry. Using the
    <type scope="com::sun::star::registry">XSimpleRegistry</type> interface, the
    service can be bound to a subtree within the configuration tree, as provided
    by an <service scope="com.sun.star.configuration">ConfigurationProvider</service>
    service, which must be accessible from the service factory you use for the
    creation of this service.
    <BR>
    There are some restrictions when accessing a configuration tree using a registry.
    Most of them are implications of the fact that a configuration tree is very static in
    it's structure. Removal and addition of sub nodes is allowed only for special
    nodes, and even then the new elements have to comply to a given scheme (which is some
    kind of attribute of the container node). So for instance the
    <method scope="com.sun.star.registry">XRegistryKey::createKey</method> method is not allowed
    for some nodes.
    <BR>
    Thus anybody using this service is strongly advised to read and understand the specification
    of an configuration provider (<service scope="com.sun.star.configuration">ConfigurationProvider</service>)
    and all of it's aspects.
