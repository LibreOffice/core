/** provides dialogs implementing the

 */
interface XDialogProvider2 : ::com::sun::star::awt::XDialogProvider {


    /** creates a dialog for the given URL accepting an Interface used
        to handle dialog events.

        @param URL
            is the URL.

        @param xHandler
            is the interface that will be called to handle the Events that
            are generated by the dialog (and all controls placed on it) and
            bound to the handler using a vnd.sun.star.UNO URL specifying a
            handler method to be called. Usually this will be done directly
            by the user.

            xHandler can handle events in two different ways:

            1. By supporting the com::sun::star::awt::XDialogEventHandler interface.
            This is a generic interface to accept event notifications.

            2. By providing interfaces that directly implement the handler
            methods to be called. The XDialogProvider2 implementation then
            will try to access these events using the
            com::sun::star::beans::IntrospectionIntrospection
            service. To make this possible the handler implementation also has to
            support com::sun::star::lang::XTypeProvider.

            If XDialogEventHandler is supported XDialogEventHandler.callHandlerMethod()
            is always called first to handle the event. Only if the event cannot be
            handled by XDialogEventHandler (callHandlerMethod() then has to return
            false) or if XDialogEventHandler is not supported at all the Introspection
            based access will be used.

            The Introspection based access tries to call a method named according to the
            HandlerMethodName specified by a
            <code>vnd.sun.star.UNO:<i>HandlerMethodName</i></code> URL.
            First a method

            void HandlerMethodName( [in] com::sun::star::awt::XDialog xDialog, [in] any aEvent )

            will be searched. The signature is similar to XDialogEventHandler.
            callHandlerMethod except for MethodName itself that isn't needed
            here. For more information about these parameters, see
            com::sun::star::awt::XDialogEventHandler.

            If this method is found, it will be called, otherwise a method

            void HandlerMethodName( void )

            will be searched and called.

        @returns
            a dialog implementing the com::sun::star::awt::XDialog interface.

        @throws com::sun::star::lang::IllegalArgumentException
            if no dialog for the given URL is found or if the URL is invalid
            or xHandler is null.

        @see com::sun::star::awt::XDialogEventHandler
