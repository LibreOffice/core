/** a semantic event which indicates that a component-defined action occurred.

    <p>This high-level event is generated by a component (such as a Button)
    when the component-specific action occurs (such as being pressed).
    The event is passed to every <type>XActionListener</type> object
    that registered to receive such events using the component's
    <code>addActionListener</code> method.</p>

    <p>The object that implements the <type>XActionListener</type> interface
    gets this ActionEvent when the event occurs. The listener is therefore
    spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and mouse
    clicks, and can instead process a "meaningful" (semantic) event like
    "button pressed".</p>
