    <ul><li>CurrentItem: The RGB code of the background color is RGB(194, 211, 238)</li>
        <li>ImageURL: The image referenced by the URL is placed in the lower right corner
            of the control.</li>
        <li>Graphic: The graphic is placed in the lower right corner of the control.</li>
        <li>Complete: When set to <FALSE/> a non interactive RoadmapItem is appended
            after the last roadmap item, labeled with three dots, indicating incompleteness.</li>
        <li>Interactive: When activating a RoadmapItem (see <type>RoadmapItem</type>) the
            information about which Item has been selected is passed over when an itemlistener
            has been registered at the control.</li>
