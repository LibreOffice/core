        <li>ImageURL: The image referenced by the URL is placed in the lower right corner
            of the control.</li>
        <li>Graphic: The graphic is placed in the lower right corner of the control.</li>
        <li>Complete: When set to `FALSE` a non interactive RoadmapItem is appended
            after the last roadmap item, labeled with three dots, indicating incompleteness.</li>
        <li>Interactive: When activating a RoadmapItem (see RoadmapItem) the
            information about which Item has been selected is passed over when an itemlistener
            has been registered at the control.</li>
