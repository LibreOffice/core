/** specifies an abstract control.

    <p>All components which implement this service can
    be integrated in a windowing environment. This service describes
    the controller of the Smalltalk model view controller design.</p>

    <p>You must set a model and a stub to the UnoControl before using
    other methods.  The implementation only allows the change of the
    graphics (<type>XView</type>) if the window is not visible. The
    change of the graphics in visible state should redirect the output
    to these graphics, but this behavior is implementation-specific.</p>

    <p>The change of data directly at the control may not affect the
    model data. To ensure this behavior, modify the data of the model.</p>
