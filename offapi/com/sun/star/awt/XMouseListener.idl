 * <ul>
 *   <li>com::sun::star::awt::XMouseClickHandler</li>
 *   <li>com::sun::star::awt::XMouseMotionHandler</li>

 * @see com::sun::star::awt::XVclContainer The function getWindows might be helpful to find the

        for a single mouse press: For example, if, on your operating system,

        then you will receive one call to mousePressed() indicating
        the mouse click, and another one indicating the context menu request. For
        the latter, the MouseEvent::PopupTrigger member of the
        event will be set to `TRUE`.</p>
