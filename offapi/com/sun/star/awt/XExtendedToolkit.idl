/** The <type>XExtendedToolkit</type> is an extension of the <type
    scope="::com::sun::star::awt">XToolkit</type> interface.  It basically
    provides access to three event broadcasters which are used for instance
    in the context of accessibility.  It is, however, not restricted to
    accessibility.

    <p>The first event broadcaster lets you keep track of the open top-level
    windows (frames).  To get the set of currently open top-level window use
    the <member>XExtendedToolkit::getTopWindowCount</member> and
    <member>XExtendedToolkit::getTopWindow</member> methods.</p>

    <p>The second event broadcaster informs its listeners of key events.
    Its listeners can, unlike with most other broadcasters/listeners,
    consume events, so that other listeners will not be called for consumed
    events.</p>

    <p>The last event broadcaster sends events on focus changes of all
    elements that can have the input focus.</p>
