/** A control that displays a set of hierarchical data as an outline.

    <p>
    <h4>The Data Model</h4>
    <p>A specific node in a tree is identified by a <type>XTreeNode</type>.
    A leaf node is a node without any children and that returns <FALSE/> when calling <member>XTreeNode::hasChildrenOnDemand()</member>.
    An expanded node is a non-leaf node that will displays its children when all its ancestors are expanded.
    A collapsed node is one which hides them.
    A node is visible when all parent nodes are expanded and the node itself is in the display area.
    </p>

    <p>The nodes are retrieved from a <type>XTreeDataModel</type>.
    You can implement it yourself or use the <type>MutableTreeDataModel</type>
    which uses <type>XMutableTreeNode</type> and <type>XMutableTreeDataModel</type>
    for a simple and mutable data model.

    <p>The data model must be set at the <member>TreeControlModel::TreeDataModel</member> property.</p>

    <h4>Selection</h4>
    <p>If you are interested in knowing when the selection changes implement a
    <type scope="com::sun::star::view">XSelectionChangeListener</type> and add the instance with the method
    <member scope="::com::sun::star::view">XSelectionSupplier::addSelectionChangeListener()</member>.
    You than will be notified for any selection change.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you are interested in detecting either double-click events or when a user clicks on a node,
    regardless of whether or not it was selected, you can get the <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">XWindow</type>
    and add yourself as a <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">XMouseClickHandler</type>. You can use the
    method <member>XTreeControl::getNodeForLocation()</member> to retrieve the node that was under the
    mouse at the time the event was fired.
    </p>

    <h4>Adding child nodes on demand</h4>
    <p>If you want to add child nodes to your tree on demand you can do the following.
    <ul>
    <li>Make sure the parent node returns <TRUE/> for <member>XTreeNode::hasChildrenOnDemand()</member> either
    by implementing <type>XTreeNode</type> yourself or if you use the <type>MutableTreeDataModel</type>,
    use <member>XMutableTreeNode::setHasChildrenOnDemand()</member>.</li>
    <li>Implement a <type>XTreeExpansionListener</type> and add the instance with the method
    <member>XTreeControl::addTreeExpansionListener()</member>.</li>
    </ul>
    Now you get called when the node will become expanded or collapsed.
    So on <member>XTreeExpansionListener::treeExpanding()</member> you can
    check the <type>TreeExpansionEvent</type> if the parent node with children on demand is going to
    be expanded and in that case add the missing child nodes. You can also veto the expansion or
    collapsing of a parent node by using the <type>ExpandVetoException</type>.
    </p>
