    /** Handles an event generated by a dialog.

        The implementation must be aware that the EventObject argument contains types
        which it is not prepared to handle. Similarly this applies for the MethodName
        argument. In this case the method should simply return false.

        @param xDialog
            the dialog instance that generated the event. This is the same dialog instance
            that was returned by the <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">XDialogProvider2</type>
            createDialogWithHandler method when passing the XDialogEventHandler instance
            receiving the event as handler parameter.

        @param EventObject
            an object describing the event which occurred in the dialog or anything else that
            provides additional information for the event.
            If the event was caused by the dialog or any of the controls which it contains
            then the any should contain an object derived from
            <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">EventObject</type>. Typically this would be one
            of the several com::sun::star::awt::*Event types.

        @param MethodName
            the name of the function which is to be called.

        @returns
            true if the event was handled, otherwise false.

        @throws com::sun::star::lang::WrappedTargetException
            if the implementation of the method, which is determined by the argument MethodName,
            throws an exception. This exception is then wrapped into a
            <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">WrappedTargetException</type>.
