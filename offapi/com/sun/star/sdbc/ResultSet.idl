/** provides access to a table of data. A ResultSet
    object is usually generated by executing a Statement.



    <p>
    A ResultSet maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of
    data. Initially the cursor is positioned before the first row.
    The "next" method moves the cursor to the next row.
    </p>
    <p>
    The getXXX methods retrieve column values for the current
    row. You can retrieve values using either the index number of the
    column. Columns are numbered from 1.
    </p>
    <p>
    For maximum portability, ResultSet columns within each row should be
    read in left-to-right order and each column should be read only once.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the getXXX methods, the SDBC driver attempts to convert the
    underlying data to the specified type and returns a suitable
    value.
    </p>
    <p>
    Column names used as input to the findColumn method are case
    insensitive. When several columns have the same name, then the value
    of the first matching column will be returned. The column name option is
    designed to be used when column names are used in the SQL
    query. For columns that are NOT explicitly named in the query, it
    is best to use column numbers. If column names are used, there is
    no way for the programmer to guarantee that they actually refer to
    the intended columns.
    </p>
    <p>
    A ResultSet is automatically closed (disposed) by the Statement that
    generated it when that Statement is closed, re-executed, or used
    to retrieve the next result from a sequence of multiple results.
    </p>
    <p>
    The number, types, and properties of a ResultSet's columns are
    provided by the ResultSetMetaData object returned by the getMetaData
    method.
    </p>

        positioned updates may fail.
