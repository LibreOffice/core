/** is the service that every driver class must implement.

    <p>
    Each driver should supply a service that implements
    the Driver interface.

    </p>
    <p>
    The DriverManager will try to load as many drivers as it can
    find and then for any given connection request, it will ask each
    driver in turn to try to connect to the target URL.

    </p>
    <p>
    It is strongly recommended that each Driver object should be
    small and standalone so that the Driver object can be loaded and
    queried without bringing in vast quantities of supporting code.

    </p>
    <p>
    Each driver should be a one instance service.
