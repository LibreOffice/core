/** represents a precompiled SQL statement.
     <P>
     A SQL statement is pre-compiled and stored in a PreparedStatement object.
     This object can then be used to efficiently execute this statement multiple
     times.
     </P>
     <P>
     <B>
     Note:
     </B>
     The
     <code>setXXX</code>
     methods for setting IN parameter values
     must specify types that are compatible with the defined SQL type of
     the input parameter. For instance, if the IN parameter has SQL type
     Integer, then the method
     <member scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XParameters::setInt()</member>
     should be used.
     </P>
     <p>
     If arbitrary parameter type conversions are required, the method
     <member scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XParameters::setObject()</member>
     should be used with a target SQL type.
     </p>
     <p>
     Example of setting a parameter; <code>con</code> is an active connection.
     @example:StarBASIC
     <listing>
     pstmt = con.prepareStatement("UPDATE EMPLOYEES SET SALARY = ? WHERE ID = ?")
     pstmt.setDouble(1, 153833.00)
     pstmt.setLong(2, 110592)
     </listing>
     </p>
     <P>
     Only one
     <type scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">ResultSet</type>
     per
     <type scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">Statement</type>
     can be open at any point in
     time. Therefore, if the reading of one ResultSet is interleaved
     with the reading of another, each must have been generated by
     different Statements. All statement
     <code>execute</code>
     methods implicitly close a statement's current ResultSet if an open one exists.
