    <p>
    It acts like a typical bean. Before you use the RowSet, you have to specify a
    set of properties like a DataSource and a Command and other properties known of
    Statement.
    <br/>
    Afterwards, you can populate the RowSet by its execute method to fill the set
    with data.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the one hand, a RowSet can be used as a short cut to retrieve the data of a DataSource.
    You don't have to establish a connection, create a Statement, and then create
    a ResultSet. On the other hand, a row set can be used to implement capabilities for
    a result set, which are not supported by a driver result set, like caching
    strategies or update capabilities.
