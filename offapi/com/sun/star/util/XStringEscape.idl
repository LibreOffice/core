/** This interface is used to encode an arbitrary String into a
    escaped form.

    <p>The escaped form is chosen to be suitable for use with other interfaces
    of the object or service providing this interface.</p>

    <p>Any characters or character sequences that are not compatible with
    any naming rules or restrictions must be replaced by an escaped form,
    that complies to these rules.

    <p>The transformation should preserve all traits of the string that are
    generally respected by the service. For example, the case of a string
    may be lost after encoding and then decoding, if the service
    generally is case insensitive.

    <p>Other than that the encoding is one-to-one and can be reversed. The
    encoding should try to preserve as much as possible of the original
    string, to keep human-readable input human-friendly where possible.
    Strings that already conform to the naming conventions should be left
    unchanged or minimally modified.</p>
