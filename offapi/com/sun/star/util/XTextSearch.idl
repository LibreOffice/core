        1 character was inserted and 1 character replaced and an
        additional operation would be needed to match. The strict
        algorithm may match less than expected from a first glance of
        the specified arguments, but does not return false positives. </p>

        <p> If specified (<b>relaxed</b>), the search is also successful
        if the combined pool for insertions and deletions is below a
        doubled calculated limit and replacements are treated
        differently. Additionally, swapped characters are counted as one
        replacement. </p>

        <p> From a user's point of view the relaxed WLD is an
        inclusive-OR of the arguments given, for example if allowed
        insertions=2 and allowed replacements=2, the search succeeds if
        2 characters had been inserted and an additional replacement is
        needed to match. The relaxed algorithm may return false
        positives, but meets user expectation better. </p>
