/** A service to support the substitution and resubstitution of path variables.

        <p>
        A path variable must be specified with the following synatx: "$("&lt;variable-name&gt;")".
        Path variables are not case sensitive and are always provided as a UCB-complient URL's
        (for example: "file:///c:/temp" or "file:///usr/install"). This is mandatory to support an
        optional remote file system.<br>
        A user defined list of path variables is supported. This list is stored in the Office
        configuration file (org/openoffice/Office/Substitution.xml). Please have a look at the
        schema definition file which configuration structure this file uses.<br>
        There is also a set of variables that have pre-defined values:
        </p>
        <dl>
        <dt>$(inst)</dt>
        <dd>Installation path of the Office Basis layer.</dd>
        <dt>$(prog)</dt>
        <dd>Program path of the Office Basis layer.</dd>
    <dt>$(brandbaseurl)</dt>
    <dd>Installation path of the the Office Brand layer.</dd>
        <dt>$(user)</dt>
        <dd>The user installation directory.</dd>
        <dt>$(work)</dt>
        <dd>The work directory of the user. Under Windows this would be the
        "MyDocuments" subdirectory. Under Unix this would be the home-directory</dd>
    <dt>$(home)</dt>
        <dd>The home directory of the user. Under Unix this would be the home-
            directory. Under Windows this would be the "Documents and Settings\<username>"
         subdirectory.</dd>
    <dt>$(temp)</dt>
        <dd>The current temporary directory.</dd>
    <dt>$(path)</dt>
        <dd>The value of PATH environment variable.</dd>
    <dt>$(lang)</dt>
        <dd>The country code used by the Office, like 01=english, 49=german.</dd>
        <dt>$(langid)</dt>
        <dd>The language code used by the Office, like 0x0009=english, 0x0409=english us.</dd>
    <dt>$(vlang)</dt>
        <dd>The language used by the Office as a string. Like "german" for a german Office.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
        Attention: Most predefined variables describe an absolute path.
        The only exceptions are: $(lang), $(langid) and $(vlang).
        Therefore the service implementation should only substitute variables which
        are located at the start of a provided path string or are part of a multi-path.
        This special service is not designed to be a text substiution but shall
        provide (a) valid substituted path(s).
        </p>
