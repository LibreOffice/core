/** A service to support the substitution and resubstitution of path variables.

    <p>
    A path variable must be specified with the following synatx: "$("&lt;variable-name&gt;")".
    Path variables are not case sensitive and are always provided as a UCB-complient URL's
    (for example: "file:///c:/temp" or "file:///usr/install"). This is mandatory to support an
    optional remote file system.<br>
    A user defined list of path variables is supported. This list is stored in the Office
    configuration file (org/openoffice/Office/Substitution.xml). Please have a  look at the
    schema definition file which configuration structure this file uses.<br>
    There is also a set of variables that have pre-defined values:
    </p>
    <dl>
    <dt>$(inst)</dt>
    <dd>Installation path of the Office.</dd>
    <dt>$(prog)</dt>
    <dd>Program path of the Office.</dd>
    <dt>$(user)</dt>
    <dd>The user installation directory.</dd>
    <dt>$(work)</dt>
    <dd>The work directory of the user. Under Windows this would be the
    "MyDocuments" subdirectory. Under Unix this would be the home-directory</dd>
    <dt>$(home)</dt>
    <dd>The home directory of the user. Under Unix this would be the home-
        directory. Under Windows this would be the "Documents and Settings\<username>"
        subdirectory.</dd>
    <dt>$(temp)</dt>
    <dd>The current temporary directory.</dd>
    <dt>$(path)</dt>
    <dd>The value of PATH environment variable.</dd>
    <dt>$(lang)</dt>
    <dd>The country code used by the Office, like 01=english, 49=german.</dd>
    <dt>$(langid)</dt>
    <dd>The language code used by the Office, like 0x0009=english, 0x0409=english us.</dd>
    <dt>$(vlang)</dt>
    <dd>The language used by the Office as a string. Like "german" for a german Office.</dd>
    </dl>
