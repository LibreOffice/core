/** A service to support the substitution and resubstitution of path variables.

    <p>
        A path variable must be specified with the following syntax: "$("&lt;variable-name&gt;")".
        Path variables are not case sensitive and are always provided as a UCB-compliant URLs
        (for example: "file:///c:/temp" or "file:///usr/install"). This is mandatory to support an
        optional remote file system.<br>
        There is a set of variables that have pre-defined values:
    </p>
    <dl>
    <dt>\$(inst)</dt>
    <dd>Installation path of the Office.</dd>
    <dt>\$(prog)</dt>
    <dd>Program path of the Office.</dd>
    <dt>\$(user)</dt>
    <dd>The user installation directory.</dd>
    <dt>\$(work)</dt>
    <dd>The work directory of the user. Under Windows this would be the
        "MyDocuments" subdirectory. Under Unix this would be the home-directory</dd>
    <dt>\$(home)</dt>
    <dd>The home directory of the user. Under Unix this would be the home-
        directory. Under Windows this would be the CSIDL_PERSONAL directory,
        for example "Documents and Settings\<username>\Documents".</dd>
    <dt>\$(temp)</dt>
    <dd>The current temporary directory.</dd>
    <dt>\$(path)</dt>
    <dd>The value of PATH environment variable.</dd>
    <dt>\$(username)</dt>
    <dd>The username (login name) of the currently active user, excluding the domain name on Windows. (Available since LibreOffice 5.2)</dd>
    <dt>\$(langid)</dt>
    <dd>The language code used by the Office, like 0x0009=English, 0x0409=English US.</dd>
    <dt>\$(vlang)</dt>
    <dd>The language used by the Office as a string. Like "German" for a German Office.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        Attention: Most predefined variables describe an absolute path.
        The only exceptions are: \$(username), \$(langid) and \$(vlang).
        Therefore the service implementation should only substitute variables which
        are located at the start of a provided path string or are part of a multi-path.
        This special service is not designed to be a text substitution but shall
        provide (a) valid substituted path(s).
    </p>
