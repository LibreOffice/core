/** makes it possible to release any objects in a ordered manner by using
    a two-step mechanism

    <p>
    If an object should be terminated, it can be:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>disposed (if it supports <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XComponent::dispose()</member>)</li>
        <li>closed   (if it supports <member>XCloseable::close()</member>)</li>
    </ul>
    First version gives the object no chance to disagree with that (e.g. if a
    process is still running and can't be canceled really). Last version
    provides this possibility, but can't guarantee real termination of called object.
    It depends from the environment of an object, if one or both mechanism are necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
    Base interface <type>XCloseBroadcaster</type> makes it possible that any listener
    which is interested on life time of listened object ...
    <ul>
        <li>can get a notification about closing of it</li>
        <li>or can have a veto to break that.</li>
    </ul>

{
    /** try to close the object

        <p>
        Must definitely be called before <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XComponent::dispose()</member>.
        But nobody can guarantee real closing of called object - because it can disagree with that if any
        still running processes can't be canceled yet. It's not allowed to block this call till internal
        operations will be finished here. They must be canceled or call must return immediately by throwing
        the <type>CloseVetoException</type>.  Otherwise (if nothing exist to disagree) it must return normally.
        </p>

        <p>
        Before any internal processes will be canceled, all registered <type>XCloseListener</type>
        must be notified. Any of them can disagree with a <type>CloseVetoException</type> too.
        It's forbidden to catch this exception inside the called close() method because the caller must
        get this information!
        </p>

        <p>
        If somewhere disagree with a CloseVetoException it will not clear who has to close the object again
        after still running processes was finished. The parameter <var>DeliverOwnership</var> regulate that.
        If it is set to <FALSE/> the caller of the method close() will be the owner of this object in every case.
        Then it's not allowed to call close() from any other place (may a registered XCloseListener).
        If it is set to <TRUE/> the caller gives up his ownership. If a XCloseListener throw the veto exception
        he will be the new owner of the closing object. This information is passed to the listener by a parameter of
        his notification method <member>XCloseListener::queryClosing()</member>. After his operations was finished
        he MUST try to close it again. If the closing object itself disagree by an exception and the parameter
        <var>DeliverOwnership</var> was set to <TRUE/> the object will be his own owner with all consequences of that.
        <br><strong>Note:</strong><br>
        There is no way to get the ownership back if it was delivered!
        </p>

        <p>
        If this method was already called on an object it should return without any reaction. Normally it's possible to throw
        a <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">DisposedException</type> for already disposed or closed objects
        (which represent a <type scope="com::sun::star::uno">RuntimeException</type> and can be thrown by every interface call),
        but it shouldn't be used here. The veto exception should be the only way to indicates the result.
        </p>

        @param DeliverOwnership
                <TRUE/> delegates the ownership of this closing object to any one which throw the CloseVetoException.
                This new owner has to close the closing object again if his still running processes will be finished.
                <br>
                <FALSE/> let the ownership at the original one which called the close() method. He must react for possible
                CloseVetoExceptions and try it again at a later time. This can be useful for a generic UI handling.

        @throws CloseVetoException
            indicates that the closing object himself or any of his currently registered listener disagree with this close() request.

        @see XCloseListener
        @see CloseVetoException
        @see com::sun::star::lang::XComponent::dispose()
        @see com::sun::star::lang::DisposedException
