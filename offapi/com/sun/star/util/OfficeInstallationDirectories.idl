/** encapsulates access to the current office installation directory and
    office user data directory, provides functionality to create URLs
    containing relocatable (not absolute) references to the current office
    installation directory and user data directory and vice versa.

    <p>This functionality is useful when data containing references to the
    current office installation directory or user data directory must be made
    persistent and re-read later. In many cases, storing the reference
    directly would destroy the relocatability of an office installation and the
    possibility to share one office user data directory among parallel office
    installtions.
