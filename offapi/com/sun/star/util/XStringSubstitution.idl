        <p>
        The method iterates through it's internal variables list to match the
        variables in the given string. A match replaces the variable with the
        string defined for this variable. If no variable can be found in the string
        it will be returned unchanged. The behavior if a variable is found in
        the string but it is unknown for the implementation depends on the parameter
        bSubstRequired.

        @param aText
            A string containing variables that should be substituted.

        @param bSubstRequired
            Specifies if a successfull substitution is required. The
            function throws a <type scope="com::sun::star::container">NoSuchElementException</type>
            if it finds a variable that is unknown. In this case it is possible
            that the returned string would not be what the caller expected!

            Returns the resubstituted string with variables for all parts
            that could be replaced. The unchanged argument will be returned
