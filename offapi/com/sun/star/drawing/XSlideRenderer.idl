interface XSlideRenderer
{
    /** Create a preview for the given slide that has the same aspect ratio
        as the page and is as large as possible but not larger than the
        specified size.

        The reason for not using the given size directly as preview size and
        thus possibly changing the aspect ratio is that
        a) a different aspect ratio is not used often, and
        b) leaving the adaption of the actual preview size (according to the
        aspect ratio of the slide) to the slide renderer is more convenient
        to the caller than having to this himself.

        @param xSlide
            The slide for which a preview will be created.
        @param aMaximumPreviewPixelSize
            The maximum size of the preview measured in pixels.  When the
            aspect ratios of this size and of the given slide differ, then
            resulting preview will either have the width or the height of
            this size.
        @param nSuperSampleFactor
            When larger than the default 1 then internally a larger preview
            is created which, before it is returned, is scaled down to the
            requested size.  The intermediate size is nSuperSampleFactor
            times the original size.  Values larger than 1 result in higher
            memory consumption and longer runtime.
            This value is an attempt to provide some antialiasing and so to
            provide more readable slide previews.  May become obsolete in
            the future when true antialiasing suppport will be integrated.
