/** The drawing framework is responsible for managing the resources used by
    the UI of the drawing applications.
    The set of active resources is represented by the
    com::sun::star::drawing::framework::XConfiguration.</p>
    <p>The com::sun::star::drawing::framework::XControllerManager
    interface provides access to the sub controllers.  It typically is
    implemented by the same class that implements the
    com::sun::star::frame::XController interface.</p>
    <p>The
    configuration is managed by the
    com::sun::star::drawing::framework::XConfigurationController.
    It coordinates changes to the configuration made by the other sub
    controllers so that
    <ul><li>unnecessary ui updates (flickering) is avoided and</li>
    <li>and the configuration is always in a valid and meaningful
    state.</li></ul></p>
