    bounding box which the paint methods may paint over.  The center box is
    the third rectangle.  This is the actual border between outer and inner
    background color or bitmap and it is used for placing the bitmaps that are used
    paint the border.  The inner sides and corners are places relative to
    this center box, i.e. when not further offsets are given then the upper
    left corner bitmap is painted with its lower right at the upper left of
    the center box.</p>
