    This allows developers to replace the default implementation of the
    configuration controller with their own.  This may not be a useful
    feature.  Furthermore the sub controllers may need a tighter coupling
    than the interfaces allow.  These are reasons for removing this service
    in the future and let the controller manager create the sub controllers
