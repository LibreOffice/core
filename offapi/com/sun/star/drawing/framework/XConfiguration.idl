/** A configuration describes the resources of an application like panes,
    views, and tool bars and their relationships that are currently active
    or are requested to be activated.  Resources are specified by ResourceId
    structures rather than references so that not only the current
    configuration but also a requested configuration can be represented.

    <p>Direct manipulation of a configuration object is not advised with the
    exception of the <type>ConfigurationController</type> and objects that
    implement the <type>XConfigurationChangeRequest</type> interface.</p>

        indirectly to the given anchor.  A URL filter can reduce the set of
        returned resource ids.
        @param xAnchorId
            This anchor typically is either a pane or an empty
            <type>XResourceId</type> object.  An
            empty reference is treated like an <type>XResourceId</type> object.
        @param sURLPrefix
            When a non-empty string is given then resource ids are returned
            only when their resource URL matches this prefix, i.e. when it
            begins with this prefix or is equal to it.  Characters with
            special meaning to URLs are not interpreted.  In the typical
            usage the prefix specifies the type of a resource.  A typical
            value is "private:resource/floater/", which is the prefix for
            pane URLs.  In a recursive search, only resource ids at the top
            level are matched against this prefix.
            <p>Use an empty string to prevent filtering out resource ids.</p>
        @param eSearchMode
            This flag defines whether to return only resources that are
            directly bound to the given anchor or a recursive search is to
            be made.  Note that for the recursive search and an empty anchor
            all resource ids are returned that belong to the configuration.
        @return
            The set of returned resource ids may be empty when there are no
            resource ids that match all conditions.  The resources in the
            sequence are ordered with respect to the
            XResourceId::compareTo() method.
