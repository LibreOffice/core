/** The configuration controller is responsible for the synchronization of
    other controllers for the management of resources like panes, views,
    tool bars, and command groups.

    <p>There are two configurations of resources:<ul>
    <li>The current configuration describes the state of resources as
    it is.</li>
    <li>The requested configuration describes how it should be.  The
    requested configuration is changed usually by calling
    <member>requestResourceActivation()</member> and
    <member>requestResourceDeactivation()</member>.  Other sub controllers
    may offer other methods for requesting configuration changes.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>When the two differ then the current configuration is updated eventually
    to reflect the requested one
    <ol>
    <li>when the last pending request for configuration changes has been
    processed,</li>
    <li>when the <member>update()</member> method is called.</li>
    <li>when the configuration manager it is unlocked after formerly being
    locked.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p>Requests for configuration changes are handled in a two step process:
    <ol>
    <li>First the requested configuration is updated iteratively: Every
    request that is being made by e.g. calling
    <member>requestResourceActivation()</member> or
    <member>requestResourceDeactivation()</member> results in one or more
    function objects, that each implement the
    <type>XConfigurationChangeRequest</type> interface, being inserted
    into a queue.  The request objects in the queue are processed one at a
    time in the order in which they are inserted.  Only when one request
    object is processed a change to the requested configuration is made.
    These changes are broadcasted.  Listeners may decide to add more request
    objects to the queue.  For example when the view in the center pane is
    replaced by another view, some listeners may want to turn some side
    panes on or off, or show other views in the side panes.</p>
    <p>This process goes on until the queue of request objects becomes
    empty.  Until this point only the requested configuration has been
    modified.  No resources have been activated or deactivated.</p></li>
    <li><p>The second update step activates or deactivates resources so that
    the current configuration (the one that comprises the actually active
    resources) reflects the requested configuration.</p>
    <p>Note that the second update step may not be able to activate (or even to
    deactivate) all the requested resources.  Either because they are
    temporarily or permanently unavailable.  For example, during the
    start-up of a new Impress application frame the side panes are displayed
    with a visible delay because they are not provided sooner by the
    underlying framework.  Such anavailable resources are not forgotten but
    remain in the requested configuration.  Every time the configuration
    controller updates its current configuration these resources are
    requested once more.</li></ol></p>

    <p>The configuration controller sends the following events:
    <ul>
    <li><const>ResourceActivationRequested</const> is sent when the
    activation of a resource has been requested and the resource is not yet
    active in the requested configuration.  The event is sent when the
    configuration change request is executed that is created when for
    example <member>requestResourceActivation()</member> is called.</p>
    <p>The <member>ResourceId</member> member is set to the requested
    resource.  The <member>ResourceObject</member> member is not not
    set.</p></li>
    <li><const>ResourceDeactivationRequest</const> is sent when the
    deactivation of a resource has been requested and the resource is active
    in the requested configuration.  The event is sent when the
    configuration change request is executed that is created when for
    example <member>requestResourceDeactivation()</member> is called.</p>
    <p>The <member>ResourceId</member> member is set to the requested
    resource.  The <member>ResourceObject</member> member is not
    set.</p></li>
    <li><const>ConfigurationUpdateStart</const> is sent before the update of
    the current configuration is started.</p>
    <p>The requested configuration is available in the <type
    scope="ConfigurationChangeEvent">Configuration</type> member.  The
    <member>ResourceId</member> and <member>ResourceObject</member> members
    are not set.</p></li>
    <li><const>ConfigurationUpdateEnd</const> is sent before the update of
    the current configuration is started.</p>
    <p>The requested configuration is
    available in the <type scope="ConfigurationChangeEvent"
    >Configuration</type> member.  The <member>ResourceId</member> and
    <member>ResourceObject</member> members are not set.</p></li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>The sub controllers that manage individual resources (like
    <type>XPaneController</type>, <type>XViewController</type>,
    <type>XToolbarController</type>, and <type>XCommandController</type>)
    send the following events:
    <ul>
    <li><const>ResourceActivation</const> is sent when a resource is
    activated, i.e. when a new object of a resource is created (or taken
    from a cash).</p>
    <p>The <member>ResourceId</member> and <member>ResourceObject</member>
    members are set to the <type>ResourceId</type> and object reference of
    the activated resource.</p></li>
    <li><const>ResourceDeactivation</const> is sent when a resource is
    deactivated, i.e. when an object that previously was part of the
    configuration is removed from the configuration.</p>
    <p>The <member>ResourceId</member> and <member>ResourceObject</member>
    members are set to <type>ResourceId</type> and object reference of the
    deactivated resource.</p></li>
    </ul></p>
