/** The configuration controller is responsible for the management of the
    set of active resources.

    <p>There are two configurations of resources:<ul>
    <li>The current configuration contains the set of currently active
    resources.</li>
    <li>The requested configuration describes what the current configuration
    should be.  The requested configuration is changed usually by calling
    <member>requestResourceActivation()</member> and
    <member>requestResourceDeactivation()</member>.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>When the two configurations differ then the current configuration is
    updated eventually to reflect the requested configuration.  An update
    takes place when the following three conditions are fulfilled.
    <ol>
    <li>when the last pending request for configuration changes has been
    processed,</li>
    <li>when the <member>update()</member> method is called.</li>
    <li>when the configuration manager it is unlocked after formerly being
    locked.</li>
    </ol></p>

    <p>Requests for configuration changes are handled in a two step process:
    <ol>
    <li>First the requested configuration is updated iteratively: Every
    request that is being made by calling
    <member>requestResourceActivation()</member> or
    <member>requestResourceDeactivation()</member> results in one or more
    function objects, that each implement the
    <type>XConfigurationChangeRequest</type> interface.  These are inserted
    into a queue.  The request objects in the queue are processed
    asynchronously one at a time in the order in which they are inserted.
    Only when one request object is processed a change to the requested
    configuration is made.  These changes are broadcasted to registered
    <type>XConfigurationChangeListener</type> objects.  Listeners may
    decide to make requests that then are added to the queue.  For example
    when the view in the center pane is replaced by another view, some
    listeners may want to turn some side panes on or off, or show other
    views in the side panes.</p>
    <p>This process goes on until the queue of request objects becomes
    empty.  Until this point only the requested configuration has been
    modified.  No resources have been activated or deactivated.</p></li>

    <li><p>The second update step activates or deactivates resources so that
    the current configuration (the one that comprises the actually active
    resources) reflects the requested configuration.</p>
    <p>The order in which resources are activated or deactivated depends on
    the dependency between the resources.  For example a view depends on the
    pane it is displayed in.  Resources that other resources depend on are
    activated first and deactivated last.  The order is undefined for
    unrelated resources.</p>
    <p>Note that the second update step may not be able to activate (or even to
    deactivate) all the requested resources.  Either because they are
    temporarily or permanently unavailable.  For example, during the
    start-up of a new Impress application the side panes are displayed
    with a visible delay because they are not provided sooner by the
    underlying framework.  Such unavailable resources are not forgotten but
    remain in the requested configuration.  Every time the configuration
    controller updates its current configuration these resources are
    requested once more.</li></ol></p>

    <p>The configuration controller sends the following events:
    <ul>
    <li><const>ResourceActivationRequested</const> is sent when the
    activation of a resource has been requested and the resource is not yet
    active in the requested configuration.  The event is sent when the
    configuration change request is executed, not when the
    <member>requestResourceActivation()</member> call is made.</p>
    <p>The <member scope="ConfigurationChangeEvent">ResourceId</member> member is set to the requested
    resource.  The <member>ResourceObject</member> member is not
    set.</p></li>
    <li><const>ResourceDeactivationRequested</const> is sent when the
    deactivation of a resource has been requested and the resource is active
    in the requested configuration.  The event is sent when the
    configuration change request is executed that is created when for
    example <member>requestResourceDeactivation()</member> is called.</p>
    <p>The <member>ResourceId</member> member is set to the requested
    resource.  The <member>ResourceObject</member> member is not
    set.</p></li>
    <li><const>ConfigurationUpdateStart</const> is sent before the update of
    the current configuration starts.</p>
    <p>The requested configuration is available in the <member
    scope="ConfigurationChangeEvent">Configuration</member> member.  The
    <member>ResourceId</member> and <member>ResourceObject</member> members
    are not set.</p></li>
    <li><const>ConfigurationUpdateEnd</const> is sent after the update of
    the current configuration ends.</p>
    <p>The requested configuration is
    available in the <member scope="ConfigurationChangeEvent"
    >Configuration</member> member.  The <member>ResourceId</member> and
    <member>ResourceObject</member> members are not set.</p></li>
    <li><const>ResourceActivation</const> is sent when a resource is
    activated, i.e. when a new object of a resource is created (or taken
    from a cash).</p>
    <p>The <member>ResourceId</member> and <member>ResourceObject</member>
    members are set to the <type>XResourceId</type> and object reference of
    the activated resource.</p></li>
    <li><const>ResourceDeactivation</const> is sent when a resource is
    deactivated, i.e. when an object that previously was part of the
    configuration is removed from the configuration.</p>
    <p>The <member>ResourceId</member> and <member>ResourceObject</member>
    members are set to <type>XResourceId</type> and object reference of the
    deactivated resource.</p></li>
