/** The XControllerManager gives access to the sub controllers that provide
    the different aspects of the drawing framework.
    <p><strong>This interface is not yet in its final form and will probably change
    considerably.</strong></p>
    <p>The <type>XControllerManager</type> interface is typically
    implemented by the same object that implements <type
    scope="com::sun::star::frame">XController</type>.</p>
    <p>The sub controllers that this interface gives access to come from
    different sources:
    <ul><li>The core sub controllers are created by instantiating a service
    from a predefined set of services.  These are <type>CommandController</type>,
    <type>ConfigurationController</type>, <type>ModuleController</type>,
    <type>PaneController</type>, <type>ToolbarController</type>, and
    <type>ViewController</type>.  There explicit access methods for all of
    these services.</li>
    <li>Optional sub controllers that are created by instantiating
    services can be added and removed with the
    <member>registerController()</member> and
    <member>removeController()</member> methods.</li>
    <li>Optional sub controllers who are added as living objects.  There are
    not methods for this yet.</li>
    </ul>
    One motivation for optional sub controllers that can be added at runtime
    is to allow the slide sorter register a sub controller that exports its
    (multi) selection.  This selection is used for example by controls in
    the task pane.  A sub controller is one way of providing a central
    access point to the selection of the slide sorter which may be shown
    either in the center pane or the left pane or not at all.</p>
