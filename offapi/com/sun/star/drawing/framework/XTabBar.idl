/** UI control for the selection of views in a pane.
    <p>Every tab of a tab bar has, besides its localized title and help
    text, the URL of a view.  A possible alternative would be to use a
    command URL instead of the view URL.</p>
    <p>In the current Impress implementation a tab bar is only used for the
    center pane to switch between views in the center pane.  Tab bars can
    make sense for other panes as well, i.e. for showing either the slide
    sorter or the outline view in the left pane.</p>
    <p>Tab bar buttons are identified by their resource id.  Note that
    because the resource anchors are all the same (the tab bar), it is the
    resource URL that really identifies a button. There can not be two
    buttons with the same resource id.</p>
