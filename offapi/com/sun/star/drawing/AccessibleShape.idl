/** The <type>AccessibleShape</type> service is implemented by UNO shapes to
    provide accessibility information that describe the shapes' features.
    A UNO shape is any object that implements the <type
    scope="::com::sun::star::drawing">XShape</type> interface.

    <p>The content of a draw page is modeled as tree of accessible shapes
    and accessible text paragraphs.  The root of this (sub-)tree is the
    accessible draw document view.  An accessible shape implements either
    this service or one of the 'derived' services
    <type>AccessibleGraphicShape</type> or <type>AccessibleOLEShape</type>.
    See the section Children in the description of the
    <type>XAccessibleContext</type> interface support for more details.</p>

    <p>There are two services that extend this one:  the
    <type>AccessibleGraphicShape</type> and the
    <type>AccessibleOLEShape</type> services provide additional interfaces.
    See there for details.</p>

    <p>A shape object is either fully or partially visible on the screen or
    has set the state DEFUNC to indicate that it is no longer actively
    supported by its parent.</p>

    <p>Each shape object that has not set the DEFUNC state has a valid
    parent.  That is either the containing draw page or a group shape or a
    3D scene object.</p>

    /** Give access to the structural information of a shape.

        <p>You can access the following information for the shape being made
        accessible:
        <ul>
        <li>Role: The role of all shapes is <const
            scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
            >AccessibleRole::SHAPE</const>.</li>
        <li>Name: The name of a shape is its localized type name.</li>
        <li>Description: Descriptions are localized and start with the
            shape's type and style.  After that follow some properties that
            differ from the defaults with respect to the style.
        <li>Children: The children of a shape are either other accessible
            shapes or accessible text paragraphs.  Only group shapes, 3D scene
            shapes, and OLE shapes may contain other shapes as children.
            Some of the shapes may have text paragraphs as (additional)
            children.  See <type>(Yet to be written)</type> for details of
            how this text is represented.</li>
        <li>Parent: The parent is either the document view as represented by
            <type>AccessibleDrawDocumentView</type> or a group shape, 3D
            scene shape, or OLE shape.</li>
        <li>Relations: Are set and maintained from the outside.  See the
        service description of the object that has accessible shapes as
        children for details.</li>
        <li>States: The states supported by this service are:
            <ul>
            <li><p><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::DEFUNC</const> is set if an accessible
                shape is not visible but still existent for some reason.
                This should not really happen and is a sign that someone,
                e.g. an AT-Tool holds references to such a shape.  The
                reason for this is that either the owner of the accessible
                shape did not remove it from its list of children or that
                the AT-Tool does not care for the events indicating
                this.</p>
                <p>Usually an object that has the <const
                scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::DEFUNC</const> state set has already
                been disposed and subsequent calls to this object result in
                <type>DisposedException</type> exceptions.</p>
                <p>If this state is set then no other of the states below is
                set.  This  is also true for the states that are otherwise
                allways set (which  makes 'allways' more of a sort of
                'normally').</p></li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::EDITABLE</const></li> is always set.
                This state is interpreted to mean that not only text but
                also other, graphical, properties of a shape can be modified.
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::ENABLED</const> is always set.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::FOCUSABLE</const> is always set.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::FOCUSED</const> is set according to
                whether the shape currently has the focus.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::MULTILINE</const> is set if a shape
                supports the <type>XAccessibleText</type> interface.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::OPAQUE</const> is set for certain shapes
                with certain attributes like for a filled rectangle.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::RESIZABLE</const> is always set.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::SELECTABLE</const> is always set.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::SELECTED</const> is set according to
                whether the shape is currently selected.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::SHOWING</const> is always set.</li>
            <li><const scope="com::sun::star::accessibility"
                >AccessibleStateType::VISIBLE</const> is always set.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Locale: The shape returns the locale of its parent.</li>
        <li>Property change listeners: Property change listeners that are
            registered with a shape are informed of the usual events.</li>
