/** The <type>AccessibleDrawDocumentView</type> service is implemented by
    views of Draw and Impress documents.

    <p>An object that implements the <type>AccessibleDrawDocumentView</type>
    service provides information about the view of a Draw or Impress
    document in one of the various view modes.  With its children it gives
    access to the current page and the shapes on that page.</p>

    <p>This service gives a simplified view on the underlying document.  It
    tries both to keep the structure of the accessibility representation
    tree as simple as possible and provide as much relevant information as
    possible.  This has the following consequences:
    <ol>
    <li>Only the current draw page and only the visible shapes are
    accessible.  To switch to another page or to access shapes that lie
    outside the currently visible area, the user has to issue these requests
    manually or programmatically through the usual channels, e.g. pressing
    keys or selecting menu entries.</li>
    <li>The hierarchy exposed through the
    <type scope="::com::sun::star::accessibility">XAccessibleContext</type>
    interface does not necessarily correspond directly to the underlying
    draw page structure.  Internal nodes in this hierarchy are introduced
    by group shapes, 3D scenes, and OLE objects.</li>
    <li>The view modes editing view, outline view, slides view, notes view,
    handout view, and presentation view are not exposed explicitly.
    However, if there happens to be a view mode change which results in a
    rearrangement of the visible shapes, the user gets notified of this.</li>
    </ol></p>

        Draw Document Outline", or "slide window".</li>
        <li>Children: The shapes of the current draw page that are currently
            visible are direct and indirect children of (an object
            implementing)
            this service.  Group shapes, 3D scenes, and OLE objects
            introduce further levels into the hierarchy.  If the visibility
            of shapes changes--due to
            scrolling, switching the current draw page, or changing the view
            mode--the appropriate listeners are called and the user gets
            informed of this.</li>
        <li>Parent: The parent will usually be the window that contains the
            draw document view.  It has to be set via implementation dependent
            ways.</li>
