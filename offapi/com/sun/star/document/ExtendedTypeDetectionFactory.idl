        <p>
        A detection component must be specified by it's uno implementation name and will be crated then.
        Every new created component can be intialized with it's own configuration data
        and may given optional arguments of the corresponding createInstanceWithArguments() request. To do so the
        service must support the optional interface <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XInitialization</type>.
        The arguments parameter will have the following structure:
        <ul>
            <li>sequence< Any >[0] contains a sequence< <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue</type> >,
                which represent the configuration data set of this detector component. The used properties are the same, as
                they are available at the container interface of this factoyr service. (see below)</li>
            <li>Every following item of the argument list sequence< Any >[1..n] contains the copied argument of the
                corresponding createInstanceWithArguments() call. That means: Item 0 or the original list was copied as
                item 1 of the destination list ... etc.

        Because the complexness of such configuration set can be very high,
        it seams not very usefull to update the undelying configuration layer
        on every container change request immediatly. Another strategy can be to
        make all changes (adding/changing/removing of items) and call flush at the end.
        That will validate the whole container and reject inconsistent data sets.
        Only in case all made changes was correct, they will be written back to the
        configuration. Further this interface provides the possibelity, that interested
        changes listener can be registered too.
