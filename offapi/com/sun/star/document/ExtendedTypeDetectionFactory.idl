        <p>
        A detection component must be specified by its UNO implementation name and will be crated then.
        Every new created component can be initialized with its own configuration data
        and may given optional arguments of the corresponding createInstanceWithArguments() request. To do so the
        service must support the optional interface com::sun::star::lang::XInitialization.
        The arguments parameter will have the following structure:
        <ul>
            <li>sequence< Any >[0] contains a sequence< com::sun::star::beans::PropertyValue >,
                which represent the configuration data set of this detector component. The used properties are the same, as
                they are available at the container interface of this factory service. (see below)</li>
            <li>Every following item of the argument list sequence< Any >[1..n] contains the copied argument of the
                corresponding createInstanceWithArguments() call. That means: Item 0 or the original list was copied as
                item 1 of the destination list ... etc.

        Because the complexness of such configuration set can be very high,
        it seems not very useful to update the underlying configuration layer
        on every container change request immediately. Another strategy can be to
        make all changes (adding/changing/removing of items) and call flush at the end.
        That will validate the whole container and reject inconsistent data sets.
        Only in case all made changes was correct, they will be written back to the
        configuration. Further this interface provides the possibility, that interested
        changes listener can be registered too.
