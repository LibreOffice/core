        Because the complexness of such configuration set can be very high,
        it seams not very usefull to update the undelying configuration layer
        on every container change request immediatly. Another strategy can be to
        make all changes (adding/changing/removing of items) and call flush at the end.
        That will validate the whole container and reject inconsistent data sets.
        Only in case all made changes was correct, they will be written back to the
        configuration. Further this interface provides the possibelity, that interested
        changes listener can be registered too.
