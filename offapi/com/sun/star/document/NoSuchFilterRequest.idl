/** should be used for interaction to handle states of unknown filter during detection

    <p>
    If during loading time the filter can't be detected and wasn't given at calling time,
    a possible com::sun::star::task::InteractionHandler will be used.
    (it's a part of used MediaDescriptor)
    Such "NoSuchFilterRequest" will be used then to start right interaction on that to
    get a decision which filter should be used for given URL. A possible continuation
    of type XInteractionFilterSelect will transport this decision back to
    generic filter detection and force using of it. Of course it's possible to abort
    the loading process by use another continuation com::sun::star::task::XInteractionAbort.
    </p>
