    <p>This interface encapsulates functionality to get/resolve binary data streams.
    It is used to transform binary data to an url or to transform an url to binary
    data. The binary data is represented through input and output streams.</p>

    <p>In the case of transforming an url to binary data, the <code>getInputStream</code>
    method is used. This returns a <type scope="com::sun::star::io">XInputStream</type>
    from which the binary data, transformed from the given url, can be read.</p>

    <p>In the case of transforming binary data to an url, a
    <type scope="com::sun::star::io">XOutputStream</type> is created first to write
    the binary data to. After this, the <code>resolveOutputStream</code> method can
    be used to transform the binary data, represented through the
    <type scope="com::sun::star::io">XOutputStream</type> interface, to an url.</p>
