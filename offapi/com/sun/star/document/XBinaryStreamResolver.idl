    <p>This interface encapsulates functionality to get/resolve binary data streams.

    data. The binary data is represented through input and output streams.</p>

    <p>In the case of transforming a URL to binary data, the <code>getInputStream</code>
    method is used. This returns a com::sun::star::io::XInputStream
    from which the binary data, transformed from the given URL, can be read.</p>

    com::sun::star::io::XOutputStream is created first to write
    the binary data to. After this, the <code>resolveOutputStream</code> method can
    be used to transform the binary data, represented through the
    com::sun::star::io::XOutputStream interface, to a URL.</p>
