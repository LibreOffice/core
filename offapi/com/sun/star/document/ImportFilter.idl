    Such filters can be used for importing a content.

        <p>
        It's used to filter a document at loading time.
        The target document should be already setted by using another interface
        <member>ImportFilter::XImporter</member> which is supported by this service too.
        </p>

        <p>
        Tip:<br>
        If same implementation provides the service <type>ExportFilter</type> too,
        code must distinguish between filtering into a target document (for import) or
        filtering from a source document (for export). This can be recognized by saving
        state of used interfaces <type>XExporter</type> or <type>XImporter</type>!
        Otherwise it's not clear which action is required here.
         </p>

        A filter object must be created by global service <type>FilterFactory</type>.
        If filter supports this optional interface, he will be initialized by the factory directly
        after creation. The factory will pass follow informations to this new instance:
            <ul>
                <li>first item will be a set of configuration data of the filter</li>
                <li>after that will follow may given optional parameters of call
                    <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XMultiServiceFactory::createInstanceWithArguments()</member>
                    of service <type>FilterFactory</type>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        See description of service <member>FilterFactory::XNameContainer</member> for a description of
        possible configuration data.

        <p>
        This internal filter name can be used on service <type>FilterFactory</type>
        to get further informations about it (e.g. his registration for mime types or extensions etc.)
        It's important that returned string is the "internal name" of the filter which must be
        unambigous against all other registered filter in current instalation.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Attention!</strong><br>
        Supported method setName() sould be ignored or forwarded to the FilterFactory.
        It's not allowed to set it directly to the configuration. Because it depends
        from real implementation of the FilterFactory if it will be allowed or not!
