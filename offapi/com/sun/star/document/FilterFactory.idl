published service FilterFactory
{
    /** factory interface to create and initialize filter components.

        <p>
        <strong>Current behavior</strong><p>
        The methods createInstance() or createInstanceWithArguments() of this interface must be
        called with an internal type name!. This name is used internally to search a suitable
        (mostly the default) filter for this type then. The found filter will be created, initialized
        and returned then. Creation of a filter by using it's internal filter name directly can be
        reached by using createInstanceWithArguments() with an optional property "FilterName" only.
        See the following example:

        <listing>
        private com.sun.star.uno.XInterface createFilterDirect( com.sun.star.lang.XMultiServiceFactory xFilterFactory      ,
                                                                java.lang.String                       sInternalFilterName )
        {
            com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue aFilterProp = new com.sun.star.beans.PropertyValue();
            aFilterProp.Name  = "FilterName";
            aFilterProp.Value = sInternalFilterName;

            com.sun.star.uno.Any[] lProps = new com.sun.star.uno.Any[1];
            lProps[0] = aFilterProp;

            java.lang.Object aFilter = xFilterFactory.createInstanceWithArguments("", lProps);
            return (com.sun.star.uno.XInterface)UnoRuntime.queryInterface(com.sun.star.uno.XInterface.class, aFilter);
        }
        </listing>
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Proposed behavior</strong><p>
        Searching of a suitable filter for a given internal type name, must be done by the new interface
        <type scope="com::sun::star::container">XContainerQuery</type>, available on this factory too.
        The factory interface can be used to create filter components by it's internal filter name only.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>How it can be distinguished?</strong><p>
        The new proposed implementation will throw an <type scope="com::sun::star::container">NoSuchElementException</type>
        if the first parameter of createInstance() or createInstanceWithArguments() does not match to a valid container (means
        filter) item. Further it will throw an <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">IllegalArgumentException</type> if the optional
        parameter "FilterName" could not be detected inside the argument list of call createInstanceWithArguments().
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Initialization of a filter component</strong><p>
        Every filter, which was created by this factory can(!) be initialized with it's own configuration data
        and may given optional arguments of the corresponding createInstanceWithArguments() request. To do so the filter
        instance must support the optional interface <type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XInitialization</type>.
        The arguments parameter will have the following structure:
        <ul>
            <li>sequence< Any >[0] contains a sequence< <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue</type> >,
                which represent the configuration data set of this filter. The used properties are the same, as
                they are available at the container interface of this factory service. (see below)</li>
            <li>Every following item of the argument list sequence< Any >[1..n] contains the copied argument of the
                corresponding createInstanceWithArguments() call. That means: Item 0 or the original list was copied as
                item 1 of the destination list ... etc.
        </ul>
        </p>
     */

        <p>
