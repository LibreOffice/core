    /** returns the query previously set at the analyzer, with all application-level
        features being substituted by their database-level counterparts.

        <p>The <type>XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer</type> is an application-level component,
        which in some respect understands SQL features usually not present at the database
        level. As a prominent example, you might pass a <code>SELECT</code> statement to the analyzer
        which is based on another query.</p>

        <p>While all other methods will handle those additional features transparently - e.g.
        the query in the <code>FROM</code> part of a <code>SELECT</code> statement will be handled
        as if it really is a table -, <code>getQueryWithSubstitution</code> gives you the SQL statement
        where all those features have been stripped, and replaced with appropriate standard SQL.</p>

        <p>For example, consider a database document which contains a client-side query named <code>All Orders</code>.
        This query is not known to the underlying database, so an SQL statement like
        <code>SELECT * from "All Orders"</code> would be rejected by the database. However, instantiating
        a <type>SingleSelectQueryAnalyzer</type> at the <type>Connection</type> object, and passing it the above query,
        you can then use <code>getQueryWithSubstitution</code> to retrieve a statement where <code>"All Orders"</code>
        has been replaced with the <code>SELECT</code> statement which actually constitutes the <code>"All Orders"</code>
        query.</p>

        @throws com::sun::star::sdbc::SQLException
            if the query represented cannot be completely substituted. A usual case for this is a recursion in
            the sub queries: Consider a query named <code>foo</code>, which is defined as <code>SELECT * FROM "bar"</code>.
            Now assume that <code>bar</code> is a query defined as <code>SELECT * FROM "foo"</code>. Passing either
            of those statements to an analyzer, and calling <member>getQueryWithSubstitution</member>, would result
            in an exception being thrown, since it's impossible to substitute the sub queries with their
            constituting statements.
