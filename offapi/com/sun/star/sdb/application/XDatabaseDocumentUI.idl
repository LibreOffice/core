        are basically two reasons why suspending a single sub component can fail: The

        the component might be uncloseable currently, e.g. due to an open modal
        dialog, or a long-lasting operation running currently (e.g. printing).</p>

        <p>Once all sub components have been suspended, they will, in a second step,
        be closed. Again, closing might be vetoed by other instances, e.g. by a close
        listener registered at the component.</p>
