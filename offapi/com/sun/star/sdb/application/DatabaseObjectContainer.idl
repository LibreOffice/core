/** denotes different types of (maybe virtual) containers of database objects

    <p>In the database application of OpenOffice.org, database objects (such as
    tables, queries, forms, reports) can be organized in folders. This hierarchy can
    be imposed externally, or internally.

    <p>For example, when you connect to a database which supports catalogs and/or schemas,
    then those impose a natural order on the tables, in that a catalog or a schema
    is a folder of tables.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, for forms and reports, OpenOffice.org Base itself allows the
    user to create folders to organize the documents - in this case, the hierarchy is
    defined in the database document itself.</p>
