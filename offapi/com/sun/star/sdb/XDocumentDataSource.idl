        responsible for calling <member scope="com::sun::star::util">XCloseable::close</member>
        on the document as soon as it's not needed anymore.</p>

        <p>Additionally, if the caller does long-lasting processing on the document, it's advised
        to add itself as <type scope="com::sun::star::util">XCloseListener</type> to the document,
        to prevent closing as long as the processing lasts.</p>
