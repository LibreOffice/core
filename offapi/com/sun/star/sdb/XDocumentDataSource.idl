        responsible for calling com::sun::star::util::XCloseable::close()
        on the document as soon as it's not needed anymore.</p>

        <p>Additionally, if the caller does long-lasting processing on the document, it's advised
        to add itself as com::sun::star::util::XCloseListener to the document,
        to prevent closing as long as the processing lasts.</p>
