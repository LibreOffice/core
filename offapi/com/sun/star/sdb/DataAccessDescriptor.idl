    <p>Various components interacting with the database access world require to specify (or provide themselves) an object
    such as a query, a table, a result set, a connection to a data source, a column within a table, and so on.<br/>
    All of these objects are usually not specified with a single property, but with a set of properties, and for
    various objects, various (but not always different) properties are needed.<br/>
    The <code>DataAccessDescriptor</code> describes the super set of the properties for the most common
    data access objects.</p>

    <p>Every component providing or requiring a <type>DataAccessDescriptor</type> for some functionality
    is urged to specify which properties are mandatory, and which ones optional. Additionally,
    it's free to specify any additional requirements about the relations of properties.</p>
