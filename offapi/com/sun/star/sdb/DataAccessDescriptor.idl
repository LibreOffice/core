    All of these objects are usually not specified with a single property, but with a set of properties, and for
    various objects, various (but not always different) properties are needed.<br/>
    The <type>DataAccessDescriptor</type> describes the super set of the properties for the most common
    data access objects.</p>

    <p>Every component providing or requiring a <type>DataAccessDescriptor</type> for some functionality
    is urged to specify which properties are mandatory, and which ones optional. Additionally,
    it's free to specify any additional requirements about the relations of properties.</p>
