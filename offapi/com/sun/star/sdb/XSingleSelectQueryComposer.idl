    // cumulative composing

    /** sets a new elementary query for the composer

        <p>An elementary query or statement is a (single select) statement whose parts are
        not covered by the various set and get methods of the composer. That is, if the
        elementary statement contains a filter clause, a call to
        <member>XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer::getFilter</member> will not return you this
        filter. Instead, only filters which have been set using for instance <member>setFilter</member>
        are covered by the get methods.</p>

        <p>The only methods which take all parts of the elementary statement into account are
        <member>XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer::getQuery</member> and
        <member>XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer::getQueryWithSubstitution</member>, which always returns
        the complete composed query.</p>

        <p>As a result, you can use the composer to build cumulative filter expressions. That
        is, you can set <member>ElementaryQuery</member> to a statement already containing
        filters, and then use <member>setFilter</member> to append additional filters.</p>

        <p>The very same holds for sort orders, <code>HAVING</code> and <code>GROUP BY</code>
        clauses.</p>

        <p>There are various use cases for this. For instance, you might want to use the
        statement represented by a <type>QueryDefinition</type>, and extend it with additional
        filters or sort orders, while not touching the respective parts already present
        in <member>QueryDefinition::Command</member>. This can be achieved by setting the
        <member>QueryDefinition::Command</member> as <member>ElementaryQuery</member> of a
        <type>SingleSelectQueryComposer</type>.</p>

        <p>If, in such a scenario, you would be interested in the filter part of the
        <member>QueryDefinition::Command</member>, you would set it via
        <member>XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer::setQuery</member>, and retrieve the filter
        part via <member>XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer::getFilter</member>.</p>

        <p>If you'd be interested in the composed filter, you would set the
        <member>QueryDefinition::Command</member> as <member>ElementaryQuery</member>, add your
        filter, and propagate the resulting query (<member>XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer::getQuery</member>)
        to an <type>SingleSelectQueryAnalyzer</type> instance via
        <member>XSingleSelectQueryAnalyzer::setQuery</member>.</p>
