/** allows to manipulate table names.

    <p>When, in a database application, dealing with table names, there's many degrees
    of freedom to deal with. For instance, suppose you want to have the full name of a
    table object, as it should be used in a <code>SELECT</code> statement's <code>FROM</code>
    part. This requires you to evaluate whether or not the table has a catalog and/or schema
    name, to combine the catalog, the schema, and the basic table name into one name, respecting
    the database's quoting character, and the order in which all those parts should be combined.
    Additionally, you have to respect the client-side settings which tell OpenOffice.org
    to use or not use catalogs and schemas in <code>SELECT</code> at all.</p>

    <p>The XTableName interface eases this and other, similar tasks around table
    names.</p>

    <p>The component itself does not have life-time control mechanisms, i.e. you
    cannot explicitly dispose it (com::sun::star::lang::XComponent::dispose()),
    and you cannot be notified when it dies.<br/>
    However, if your try to access any of its methods or attributes, after the
    connection which was used to create it was closed, a com::sun::star::lang::DisposedException
    will be thrown.</p>
