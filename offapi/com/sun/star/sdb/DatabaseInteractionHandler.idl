/** describes a service which is able to handle database-related interactions.

    <p>Usually, you will not instantiate this service directly. Instead, you'll instantiate a generic
    <type scope="com::sun::star::task">InteractionHandler</type> service, and pass it your request. Based on
    configuration data, this implementation will decide where to forward the request to.</p>

    <p>By default, the <code>DatabaseInteractionHandler</code> feels responsible (as per configuration) for the
    following interaction types:
    <ul>
        <li><b>database related errors</b><br/>
            The general structure to transport such errors is the <type scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">SQLException</type>,
            and if your interaction request supplies such a <code>SQLException</code> (or an instance of any derived class),
            the handler will display a generic error dialog, which is able to travel the object chain which may be contained
            in the exception.
        </li>
        <li><b>parameter requests</b><br/>
            If your interaction request supplies an <type scope="com::sun::star::sdb">ParametersRequest</type>,
            the handler will open a standard dialog asking the user to fill in parameter values.
            <br/>
            In the case you want to use this feature of the handler, you should supply a special continuation
            (<type scope="com::sun::star::sdb">XInteractionSupplyParameters</type>) as well, so the
            handler can return the entered information.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
