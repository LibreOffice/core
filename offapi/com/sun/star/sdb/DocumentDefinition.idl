        of a database document's sub documents.

        <p>The com::sun::star::ucb::XCommandProcessor::execute() method
        of a <code>DocumentDefinition</code> supports at least the following commands, additionally to
        the ones already supported by the DefinitionContent:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>open</strong>: loads the sub document in an own frame. The return value of
                the <code>execute</code> method is the model of the loaded document.</li>
            <li><strong>store</strong>: stores the document.</li>
            <li><strong>openDesign</strong>: opens the sub document in an own frame, in design mode.
                The user can make changes to the document, and save those changes. The return value of
                the <code>execute</code> method is the model of the loaded document.</li>
            <li><strong>preview</strong>: retrieves an image showing a preview of the sub document.</li>
            <li><strong>getDocumentInfo</strong>: retrieves the document information, as
                com::sun::star::document::XDocumentProperties
                instance, of the sub document.</li>
            <li><strong>delete</strong>: deletes the sub document from the database document.</li>
            <li><strong>close</strong>: closes the sub document, if it had previously been opened
                using either the <code>open</code> or <code>openDesign</code> command. The return value
                of the <code>execute</code> command is a <code>boolean</code> value indicating whether
                the sub document could be closed. Reasons for not closing the document include vetoes by
                third parties, for instance, because the user opened a dialog modal to the sub document,
                or a long-running task such as printing is currently running.</li>
            <li><strong>show</strong>: shows the sub document. This is useful if you previously opened the
                document hidden, or if you previously hide it using the <em>hide</em> command.<br/>
                The <em>open</em> command is not available if the sub document has not been loaded, yet.</li>
            <li><strong>hide</strong>: hides the sub document. In opposite to the <em>close</em> command,
                only the document window is hidden, but the document is kept loaded. A subsequent execution
                of the <em>show</em> command will show the window, again.</li>
