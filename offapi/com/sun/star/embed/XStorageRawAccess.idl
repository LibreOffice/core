        This method allows to transport encrypted streams without decryption.
        Mainly this method is introduced to allow to copy one encrypted
        storage stream to another without decryption. It is not recommended to
        use this method outside of storage implementation since different
        storages implementation could have different encryption format. If the
        method is used outside of storage implementation the user code is
        responsible to get sure that the raw format of source and target
        storages is the same.

        <p>
        The difference of this method from the previous one is that it handles
        only encrypted streams. The contents of returned by these methods
        streams can differ for the same entry, since this method can add
        additional data into the stream to allow successful insertion.
