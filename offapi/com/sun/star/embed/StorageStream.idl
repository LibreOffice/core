        A storage stream is created by a storage and has a restrictions
        depending on the mode the stream is opened in.
        </p>

        <p>
        In case a stream is opened with read-write access only one instance of
        the stream can exist. It means that the stream can not be reopened
        even for readonly access until the readwrite instance is disposed.
        From the other side it is possible to open multiple streams for
        readonly access. But because of the rule mentioned above it will not
        be possible to open the stream for read-write access until all the
        readonly instances are disposed.
        </p>

        <p>
        The stream must be disposed by
        <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XComponent::dispose()</member>
        call or by explicit closing of input and output ( if provided )
        streams implementations with
        <member scope="com::sun::star::io">XInputStream::closeInput()</member>
        and
        <member scope="com::sun::star::io">XOutputStream::closeOutput()</member>
        calls.
        </p>

        <p>
        When a stream is disposed all the changes that were done for it are
        automatically flashed, so that they becomes visible from parent
        storage. It is also possible to flash the stream explicitly.
        </p>

        <p>
        In case parent storage is disposed the stream is disposed
        automatically.
