/** The <type>FileSystemStorageFactory</type> is a service that allows to
    create a <type>FileSystemStorage</type> based on URL. The URL must point
    to a folder.

    <p>
    In case
    <method scope="com::sun::star::lang">XSingleServiceFactory::createInstance</method>
    call is used the result storage will be open in read-write mode based
    on an arbitrary file system folder.
    </p>

    <p>
    In case
    <method scope="com::sun::star::lang">XSingleServiceFactory::createInstanceWithArguments</method>
    call is used a sequence of the following parameters can be used:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>parameter 1</dt>
        <dd>
                  specifies source of the object, it must be a string
                  containing URL.
        </dd>

        <dt>parameter 2</dt>
        <dd>
                  specifies mode the storage should be open in, can take
                  values from <type>ElementModes</type> constant set.
        </dd>

        <dt>parameter 3</dt>
        <dd>
                  allows to provide
                  <type scope="com::sun::star::document">MediaDescryptor</type>
                  to the storage so some parts can be used for
                  initialization, it can be for example
                  <type scope="com::sun::star::task">XInteractionHandler</type>
                  implementation.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
    The parameters are optional, that means that sequence can be empty or
    contain only first parameter, or first and second one. In case
    no parameters are provided the call works the same way as
    <member scope="com::sun::star::lang">XSingleServiceFactory::createInstance</member>.
    In case only first parameter is provided, the storage is opened in
    readonly mode.
    </p>

    <p>
    The opened storages can support read access in addition to
    specified one.
    </p>
