    <p>
    A hatch window is a kind of window that is adopted to contain
    an embedded object window to represent the contained window border
    and to handle resizing/moving in a specific way: after user have
    selected the new size/placement the hatching window sends request
    to owner for resizing/moving.
    Thus the window can not resize/move itself.
