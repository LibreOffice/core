    <p>
    The usual usage of this service is to create it, initialize with document
    frame, and to dispose the service. While disposing the service will do all
    the required actions to let the frame be closed using
    <type scope="com::sun::star::util">XCloseable</type>::close( true ). Thus
    in case there is a code that prevents closing of the frame the code
    automatically becomes the owner of the frame.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition the code will disconnect the VCL window the frame is based on
    from the container system window.
