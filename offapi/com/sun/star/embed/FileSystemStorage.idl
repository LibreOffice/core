                A file system storage is created either by
                <type>StorageFactory</type> or by <type>XStorage</type>
                interface and is controlled by refcounting. In case
                refcounting is decreased to zero the storage will be
                disposed automatically.
                </p>

                <p>
                In case a storage object is disposed the elements
                ( substorages and substreams ) are not affected.
