        <p>This method could also be used to determine, if
        the provided data is able to be rasterized by the
        implementation. The implementation should take care of
        this feature as well as setting the default image size in
        pixel within the given output parameter.</p>

        @param DataStream
            The input stream of data that should be rasterized

        @param DPI_X
            The horizontal resolution of the callers device in pixel per inch. This
            value is needed to calculate the correct dimensions of the graphic to be
            rasterized. If a value of <value>0</value> is given, a horizontal default
            resolution of 72 DPI is used.

        @param DPI_Y
            The vertical resolution of the callers device in pixel per inch. This
            value is needed to calculate the correct dimensions of the graphic to be
            rasterized. If a value of <value>0</value> is given, a vertical default
            resolution of 72 DPI is used.

        @param DefaultSizePixel
            The default rendering size in pixel of the underlying graphics
            data may be available after the call via this output parameter.

            In case no default size can be determined during initialization,
            a default pixel size of 0,0 is returned. In this case, the caller
            needs to assume a default pixel size, appropriate for the calling
            context.

        @returns
            A boolean value indicating if rasterizing of the given data is
            possible at all and if the initialization process happened
            successfully.

        the <type>XGraphic</type> container will be empty afterwards and
        the method will return false</p>

        @param Width
            The width in pixel of the graphic to be rasterized.
            This parameter is used without taking other transformation
            values into account.

        @param Height
            The height in pixel of the graphic to be rasterized.
            This parameter is used without taking other transformation
            values into account.

        @param RotateAngle
            The rotation angle of the graphic to be rasterized.
            This parameter is used without taking other transformation
            values into account. The rotation is applied after scaling
            and shearing the original image.

        @param ShearXAngle
            The horizontal shear angle of the graphic to be rasterized.
            This parameter is used without taking other transformation
            values into account. The shearing is applied after scaling
            and before rotation of the image.

        @param ShearYAngle
            The vertical shear angle of the graphic to be rasterized.
            This parameter is used without taking other transformation
            values into account. The shearing is applied after scaling
            and before rotation of the image.

        @param RasterizeProperties
            Additional properties for special needs (undefined by now)

        @param Graphic
            An interface to a graphic container into which the given data
            should be rasterized.

        @returns com::sun::star::graphic::XGraphic
            An interface to a graphic container that holds the rasterized pixel data
