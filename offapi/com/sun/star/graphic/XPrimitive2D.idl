        ::com::sun::star::geometry::AffineMatrix2D Transformation

        A transformation matrix which maps between world coordinates (which
        is equal to object's local coordinates) to view coordinates. If not
        defined, an empty transformation is implied.

        ::com::sun::star::geometry::RealRectangle2D Viewport

        Defines the visible part of the view in world coordinates. May be used
        to optimize decompositions, e.g. for 3D scenes only the visible part
        needs to be created. If not given, an empty Viewport is implied which
        means all is visible.

        double Time

        Defines the point in time for which the geometry is defined. This may
        lead to varied results for animated objects. This value is defined in the
        range [0.0 .. n[, negative values are not allowed. If not given, a value of
        0.0 is implied.
