/** represents an URI node that may occur in a RDF graph.

    <p>
    Note that this is actually an IRI, but the RDF literature speaks of URIs
    only, so we chose to use established terminology.
    </p>

    <p>
    The URI is split into a Namespace and a LocalName,
    using the first applicable of the following criteria:
    <ol>
    <li>after the first occurrence of the fragment separator: "#"</li>
    <li>after the last occurrence of the path separator: "/"</li>
    <li>after the last occurrence of the scheme separator: ":"</li>
    </ol>
    An URI without a ":" is invalid.
    This implies that the Namespace part of an URI must not be empty, while
    the LocalName part may be empty.
    </p>
