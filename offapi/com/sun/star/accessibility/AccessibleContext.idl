/** Central service of the Accessibility API that gives access to various
    facets of an object's content.

    <p>This service has to be implemented by every class that represents the
    actual accessibility information of another UNO service.  It exposes two
    kinds of information: A tree structure in which all accessible objects
    are organized can be navigated in freely.  It typically represents
    spatial relationship of one object containing a set of children like a
    dialog box contains a set of buttons.  Additionally the
    XAccessibleContext interface of this service exposes
    methods that provide access to the actual object's content.  This can be
    the object's role, name, description, and so on.</p>
