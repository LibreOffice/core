/** Collection of state types.

    <p>This list of constants defines the available set of states that an
    object that implements <type>XAccessibleContext</type> can be in.</p>

    <p>The comments describing the states is taken verbatim from the Java
    Accessibility API 1.4 documentation.</p>

    <p>We are using constants instead of a more typesafe enum.  The reason
    for this is that IDL enums may not be extended.  Therefore, in order to
    include future extensions to the set of roles we have to use constants
    here.</p>
