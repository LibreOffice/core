/** This structure describes a text segment that is embedded in a larger
    portion of text.  It is used for example by the
    <type>XAccessibleText</type> interface to describe a text portion that
    was inserted into or deleted from an accessible text.

    <p>The indices <member>TextSegment::SegmentStart</member> and
    <member>TextSegment::SegmentEnd</member> refer to the enclosing text.
    The <member>TextSegment::SegmentText</member> member contains the text
    between these two indices including the start index but not the end
    index.  With it you can use this structure without having to
    access the <type>XAccessibleText</type> interface that represents the
    enclosing text.</p>

    <p>An empty text segment is expressed by
    <member>TextSegment::SegmentStart</member> and
    <member>TextSegment::SegmentEnd</member> set to the same value.  While a
    value of -1 signals an error (like the request for a word after the last
    character of a text) all other values define the empty string at that
    position.</p>

    <p>The <member>SegmentText</member> member is a copy of the
    corresponding text segment of the enclosing text.  Modifying this
    structure does not alter the enclosing text.</p>
