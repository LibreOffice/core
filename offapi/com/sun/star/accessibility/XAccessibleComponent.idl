/** The XAccessibleComponent interface should be supported by
    any class that can be rendered on the screen.

    <p>This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive
    technology to retrieve information concerning the graphical
    representation of an object.  This interface combines methods from
    the Java interfaces <code>javax.accessibility.AccessibleComponent</code>
    and <code>javax.accessibility.AccessibleExtendedComponent</code>.</p>

    <p>Further information about the graphical appearance of an object can
    be expressed with the XAccessibleExtendedComponent
    interface.</p>

    <p>Coordinates used by the functions of this interface are specified in
    different coordinate systems.  Their scale is the same and is equal to
    that of the screen coordinate system.  In other words all coordinates
    are measured in pixel.  They differ in their respective origin:
    <ul><li>The screen coordinate system has its origin in the upper left
    corner of the current screen.  Used by the
    getLocationOnScreen() function.</li>
    <li>The origin of the parent coordinate system is the upper left corner
    of the parent's bounding box.  With no parent the screen coordinate
    system is used instead.  Used by the getLocation()
    function.</li>
    <li>The object coordinate system is relative to the upper left corner of
    an object's bounding box.  It is relative to itself so to speak.  Used
    by the containsPoint() and
    getAccessibleAtPoint() functions.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>Key bindings which are associated with an accessible component can be
    retrieved at the component's action.  The reason for this is that key
    bindings are associated with actions and directly with a component.
    This distinction becomes important when there are more than one action.
    To get access to the key bindings you have to get the
    XAccessibleAction interface of a component, provided that
    it is supported, and use the XAccessibleAction::getAccessibleKeyBinding().
