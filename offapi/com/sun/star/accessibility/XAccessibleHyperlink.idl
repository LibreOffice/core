/** Implement this interface to represent a hyperlink or a group of
    hyperlinks.

    <p>Single hyperlinks correspond to simple &lt;a href&gt; tags.  Groups
    of hyperlinks are contained in client side image maps.  Linked objects
    and anchors are implementation dependent.  This interface inherits the
    <type>XAccessibleAction</type> interface.  Especially that interface's
    <member>XAccessibleAction::getActionCount</member> method is needed to
    obtain a maximum value for the indices passed to the
    <member>XAccessibleHyperlink::getAccessibleActionAnchor</member> and
    <member>XAccessibleHyperlink::getAccessibleActionObject</member>
    methods.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the object that implements this interface has to be
    connected implicitly or explicitly with an object that implements the
    the <type>XAccessibleText</type> interface.  The
    <member>XAccessibleHyperlink::getStartIndex</member> and
    <member>XAccessibleHyperlink::getEndIndex</member> methods return
    indices with respect to the text exposed by that interface.</p>
