/** Implement this interface to represent a hyperlink or a group of
    hyperlinks.

    <p>Single hyperlinks correspond to simple &lt;a href&gt; tags. Groups
    of hyperlinks are contained in client side image maps. Linked objects
    and anchors are implementation dependent. This interface inherits the
    XAccessibleAction interface. Especially that interface's
    XAccessibleAction::getActionCount() method is needed to
    obtain a maximum value for the indices passed to the
    XAccessibleHyperlink::getAccessibleActionAnchor() and
    XAccessibleHyperlink::getAccessibleActionObject()
    methods.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the object that implements this interface has to be
    connected implicitly or explicitly with an object that implements the
    XAccessibleText interface. The XAccessibleHyperlink::getStartIndex() and
    XAccessibleHyperlink::getEndIndex() methods return
    indices with respect to the text exposed by that interface.</p>
