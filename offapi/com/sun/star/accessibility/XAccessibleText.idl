/** Implement this interface to give read-only access to a text.

    <p>The XAccessibleText interface should be implemented by
    all UNO components that present textual information on the display like
    buttons, text entry fields, or text portions of the document window.
    The interface provides access to the text's content, attributes, and
    spatial location.  However, text can not be modified with this
    interface.  That is the task of the XAccessibleEditableText
    interface.</p>

    <p>The text length, i.e. the number of characters in the text, is
    returned by XAccessibleText::getCharacterCount().
    All methods that operate on particular characters (e.g.
    XAccessibleText::getCharacterAt()) use character
    indices from 0 to length-1. All methods that operate on character
    positions (e.g. XAccessibleText::getTextRange())
    use indices from 0 to length.</p>

    <p>Please note that accessible text does not necessarily support
    selection.  In this case it should behave as if there where no
    selection.  An empty selection is used for example to express the
    current cursor position.</p>

        width being at least one pixel so that the bounding box is not
