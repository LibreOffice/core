    to the tree structure in which all accessible objects are
    organized. Each node in this tree supports this interface.  On the other
    hand it gives access to objects that expose the represented content.
    That are role, state, name, description, and relations to other objects.
    Take an OK button of a dialog as an example.  Its role is
    <const>AccessibleRole::BUTTON</const>, its name is "OK", and its description
    is something like "Accepts all changes made in the dialog".</p>
