/** Collection of roles.

    <p>This collection of constans defines the set of possible roles of
    classes implementing the <type>XAccessible</type> interface according to
    the java class javax.accessibility.AccessibleRole.  The role of an
    object describes its generic function like 'button', 'menu', or 'text'.
    You can obtain an object's role by calling the
    <member>getAccessibleRole</member> method of the
    <type>XAccessibleContext</type> interface.</p>

    <p>We are using constants instead of a more typesafe enum.  The reason
    for this is that IDL enums may not be extended.  Therefore, in order to
    include future extensions to the set of roles we have to use constants
    here.</p>

    <p>For some roles there exist two labels with the same value.  Please
    use the one with the underscrores.  The other ones are somewhat
    deprecated and will be removed in the future. </p>
