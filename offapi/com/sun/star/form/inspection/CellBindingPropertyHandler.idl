/** implements a property handler for use with an com::sun::star::inspection::ObjectInspector
    which is able to provide properties to bind a form component to a spreadsheet cell.

    <p>The handler expects a value named "ContextDocument" in the context in which it is created.
    That is, the com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext used for creating the
    CellBindingPropertyHandler is examined for a value with this name. If the object in this
    value denotes a spreadsheet document (indicated by supporting the com::sun::star::sheet::XSpreadsheetDocument
    interface), this document is used to create the com::sun::star::form::binding::ValueBindings
    to bind the inspected object to cells in this document.</p>
