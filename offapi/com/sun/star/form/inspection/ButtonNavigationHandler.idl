/** implements a property handler for use with an com::sun::star::inspection::ObjectInspector
    which is able to enhance the com::sun::star::form::component::CommandButton::ButtonType
    and com::sun::star::form::component::CommandButton::TargetURL properties of a
    com::sun::star::form::component::CommandButton.

    <p>For this, the two properties are superseded by new versions, where as button type, additional
    possible values are added for navigating the parent form of the button. For instance, in an
    com::sun::star::inspection::ObjectInspector using this handler, the user will be able
    to choose a button type saying "move to the next record", which, when chosen, well, moves the parent
    database form of the button to the next record.</p>
