/** implements a property handler for use with an <type scope="com::sun::star::inspection">ObjectInspector</type>
    which provides properties related to binding form control models to XForm bindings and validating
    the form control content.

    <p>By using an <type>XMLFormsPropertyHandler</type>, an <type scope="com::sun::star::inspection">ObjectInspector</type>
    can be used to bind form components to <type scope="com::sun::star::xforms">Binding</type> instances.
    Since those instances also support validating form control content (by supporting an
    <type scope="com::sun::star::form::validation">XValidator</type> interface), it seems reasonable to
    edit those validate-related properties (like the XSD data type to validate against) in the
    <type scope="com::sun::star::inspection">ObjectInspector</type>, too. This is what an <type>XSDValidationPropertyHandler</type>
    is good for.</p>

    <p>The handler expects a value named "ContextDocument" in the context in which it is created.
    That is, the <type scope="com::sun::star::uno">XComponentContext</type> used for creating the
    <type>CellBindingPropertyHandler</type> is examined for a value with this name. If the object in this
    value denotes a XML form document (indicated by supporting the <type scope="com::sun::star::xforms">XFormsSupplier</type>
    interface), this document is used to do XML binding related work.</p>
