/** implements a property handler for use with an com::sun::star::inspection::ObjectInspector
    which provides properties related to binding form control models to XForm bindings.

    <p>The handler introduces new properties to choose an com::sun::star::xforms::XModel
    and a com::sun::star::xforms::Binding within this model. Additionally,
    it introduces properties which reflect the different facets of the binding (e.g.
    com::sun::star::xforms::Binding::BindingExpression), so they can be changed
    directly in the com::sun::star::inspection::ObjectInspector as if they were a
    property of the form component which is being inspected.</p>

    <p>The handler expects a value named "ContextDocument" in the context in which it is created.
    That is, the com::sun::star::uno::XComponentContext used for creating the
    CellBindingPropertyHandler is examined for a value with this name. If the object in this
    value denotes a XML form document (indicated by supporting the com::sun::star::xforms::XFormsSupplier
    interface), this document is used to do XML binding related work.</p>
