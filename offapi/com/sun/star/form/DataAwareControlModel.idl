    control model (see <type scope="com::sun::star::container">XChild</type>, inherited
    via the <type>FormControlModel</type> and <type>FormComponent</type> services) has
    always to be a <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">DataForm</type>.</p>

    /** Each <type>DataAwareControlModel</type> should be resettable for setting default values.

        <p>In the context of a control model which is data-aware, the semantics of <em>default value</em>
        (see <type>XReset</type>) is as follows:<br/>
        If (and only if) the control is valid bound to a column of it's <typee scope="com::sun::star::form::component">DataForm</type>, and the form
        is not positioned on a new record (see <member scope="com::sun::star::sdb">RowSet::IsNew</member>), then
        <member>XReset::reset</member> does not reset the model's value to it's default value, but uses the
        underlying column value.<br/>
        In all other cases, the model is reset to the default value as specified by the respective property.</p>

        <p>For an example, have a look at the <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField</type>. It inherites
        the <member scope="com::sun::star::awt">UnoControlEditModel::Text</member> property from the underlying
        service, and additionally specifies the <member scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField::DefaultText</member>.
        </p>

        <p>In the context of a <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">DataForm</type>, controls are
        automatically reset when one of the following applies
        <ul><li>The form is reset by invoking it's <type>XReset</type> interface.</li>
            <li>The form moves to a new record.</li>
            <li>The changes in the current record of the form are undone</li>
        </ul>

    /** specifies the name of the bound database field.

        <p>This property makes sense in the <em>context</em> of the control model only. Normally, a control model
        is a child of a <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">DataForm</type>, which is bound
        to a higher level object such as a table or query - more general, a result set.<br/>
        This member here describes the column of this result set which the control should act for.</p>

        <p>Not every control model can be bound to every database column. Usually, super services of the
        <type>DataAwareControlModel</type> restrict the column types they can be used with.</p>

    /** references to a control model within the same document which should be used as a label.
        <p>Any user interface action which needs to refer to the control is assumed to use this
        property. <br/>
        A very common design method for forms is to group a data aware control with a label control,
        with the latter describing the content of the former. For instance, you may have a
        <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField</type>, which is bound to the e-mail
        column of your data source. Then you will probably add a
        <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">FixedText</type> which's label is "E-Mail",
        and associate it with the TextField by setting it as <member>LabelControl</member>.<br/>
        Now if you imagine a component offering data search in a form, this component will examine
        the <member>LabelControl</member> property, find the <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">FixedText</type>,
        examine it's label, and use this label to refer to the <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField</type>.
        </p>
        <p>When setting the property, a number of constraints apply:
        <ul>
            <li>The object which is to be set has to support the following interfaces
                <ul><li><type scope="com::sun::star::awt">XControlModel</type></li>
                    <li><type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XServiceInfo</type></li>
                    <li><type scope="com::sun::star::beans">XPropertySet</type></li>
                    <li><type scope="com::sun::star::container">XChild</type></li>
                </ul>
            </il>
            <li>It has to be a part of the same document as the model who's property is to be modified.</il>
            <li>Additionally, the support of a special service, indicating that the model is of the right type,
                is required. Which kind of service is in the request depends on the type of the control model.<br/>

                For instance, text fields (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField</type>) can be
                labelled by label controls only (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">FixedText</type>),
                and radio buttons (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">RadioButton</type>) can be labelled
                by group boxes (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">GroupBox</type>) only.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
