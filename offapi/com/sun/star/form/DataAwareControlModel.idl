    /** Each <type>DataAwareControlModel</type> should be resettable for setting default values.

        <p>In the context of a control model which is data-aware, the semantics of <em>default value</em>
        (see <type>XReset</type>) is as follows:<br/>
        If (and only if) the control is valid bound to a column of it's <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">DataForm</type>, and the form
        is not positioned on a new record (see <member scope="com::sun::star::sdb">RowSet::IsNew</member>), then
        <member>XReset::reset</member> does not reset the model's value to it's default value, but uses the
        underlying column value.<br/>
        In all other cases, the model is reset to the default value as specified by the respective property.</p>

        <p>For an example, have a look at the <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField</type>. It inherits
        the <member scope="com::sun::star::awt">UnoControlEditModel::Text</member> property from the underlying
        service, and additionally specifies the <member scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField::DefaultText</member>.
        </p>

        <p>In the context of a <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">DataForm</type>, controls are
        automatically reset when one of the following applies
        <ul><li>The form is reset by invoking it's <type>XReset</type> interface.</li>
            <li>The form moves to a new record.</li>
            <li>The changes in the current record of the form are undone</li>

        to a higher level object such as a table or query - more general, a result set.<br/>
        This member here describes the column of this result set which the control should act for.</p>

        <p>Not every control model can be bound to every database column. Usually, super services of the

        update is prevented, showing an error message to the user. To disable this behavior on a per-control

    /** references to a control model within the same document which should be used as a label.
        <p>Any user interface action which needs to refer to the control is assumed to use this
        property. <br/>
        A very common design method for forms is to group a data aware control with a label control,
        with the latter describing the content of the former. For instance, you may have a
        <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField</type>, which is bound to the e-mail
        column of your data source. Then you will probably add a
        <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">FixedText</type> whose label is "E-Mail",
        and associate it with the TextField by setting it as <member>LabelControl</member>.<br/>
        Now if you imagine a component offering data search in a form, this component will examine
        the <member>LabelControl</member> property, find the <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">FixedText</type>,
        examine it's label, and use this label to refer to the <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField</type>.
        </p>
        <p>When setting the property, a number of constraints apply:
        <ul>
            <li>The object which is to be set has to support the following interfaces
                <ul><li><type scope="com::sun::star::awt">XControlModel</type></li>
                    <li><type scope="com::sun::star::lang">XServiceInfo</type></li>
                    <li><type scope="com::sun::star::beans">XPropertySet</type></li>
                    <li><type scope="com::sun::star::container">XChild</type></li>
                </ul>
            </il>
            <li>It has to be a part of the same document as the model who's property is to be modified.</il>
            <li>Additionally, the support of a special service, indicating that the model is of the right type,
                is required. Which kind of service is in the request depends on the type of the control model.<br/>

                For instance, text fields (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">TextField</type>) can be
                labeled by label controls only (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">FixedText</type>),
                and radio buttons (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">RadioButton</type>) can be labeled
                by group boxes (<type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">GroupBox</type>) only.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
