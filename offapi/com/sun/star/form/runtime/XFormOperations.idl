/** encapsulates operations on a database form.

    <p>This instance allows for operations on a user interface form, by saving its clients
    from various tedious and error-prone operations.</p>

    <p>As an example, imagine you have a database form, displayed in some user
    interface, which you want to move to the next record.<br/>
    It is as easy as calling <member scope="com:::sun::star::sdbc">XResultSet::next</member>
    on this form, right? Wrong. First, you need to care for saving the current
    record, so the user doesn't lose her input. So you need to call
    <member scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XResultSetUpdate::updateRow</member> or
    <member scope="com::sun::star::sdbc">XResultSetUpdate::insertRow</member>, depending
    on the form's <member scope="com::sun::star::sdb">RowSet::IsNew</member> property.<br/>
    But then you're done, right? Wrong, again.<br/>
    When the user just entered some data into one of the form fields, but did not yet
    leave this field, then the data is not yet committed to the form, not to talk
    about being committed to the underlying database. So, before everything else,
    you would need to obtain the active control of the form, and commit it.<br/>
    <em>Now</em> you're done ...</p>

    <p>As another example, consider that you want to delete the current record from the
    form. You have to take into account any <type scope="com::sun::star::form">XConfirmDeleteListener</type>s
    registered at the <type scope="com::sun::star::form">FormController</type> or the
    <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">DataForm</type>.</p>

    <p>If you agree that this is ugly to do and maintain, then <code>XFormOperations</code>
    is for you. It provides a <member>execute</member> method, which will do all of the above
    for you; plus some similar convenient wrappers for similar functionality.</p>
