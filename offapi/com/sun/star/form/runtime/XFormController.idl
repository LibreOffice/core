/** specifies a component controlling the interaction between the user and form functionality.

    <p>As soon as a form (containing controls) is to be presented to the user,
    there is a need for an instance controlling the user interaction.<br/>
    Such a <code>FormController</code> is responsible for dialog processing,
    like controlling the tab order and the grouping of controls.</p>

    <p>As a form may contain one or many subforms, a <type>FormController</type> may
    contain one or more other <type>FormController</type>s, so the form model structure or hierarchy
    is reflected in the structure of <type>FormController</type>s. That is, retrieving the parent of
    the model of a controller will give you the same object as retrieving the model of the parent of
    the controller. Similarly, retrieving the model of the <code>n</code><sup>th</sup> child of
    a controller gives you the same object as retrieving the <code>n</code><sup>th</sup> child of
    the model of the controller.</p>

    <p>A controller is called <em>active</em> if one of the controls it is responsible for has the focus,
    else inactive. To be notified whenever this activation state of a given controller changes, you can
    add listeners.</p>

    <p>This interface supersedes the <type scope="com::sun::star::form">FormController</type>.</p>

    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>A <type>FormController</type> is responsible for a <type scope="com::sun::star::awt">UnoControlContainer</type>,
    and all controls therein.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, a form controller is responsible for preventing invalid user input. That is, if the form
    contains controls bound to a database, or to an external validator, then the form controller will
    check their current value when the current record is to be saved to the database.</p>

    <p>First, it will check whether any controls with an external validator exist. If so, those validators
    will be asked to validate the current control content. If this fails, the message provided by the validator
    is displayed to the user, the control is focused, and the update of the record is vetoed.</p>

    <p>Second, the controls are examined for NULL values. If a control is bound to a database field which
    is declared to be <code>NOT NULL</code>, no auto-increment field, but still <NULL/>, then an error
    message is shown to the user saying that input is required, the respective control is focused, and
    the update of the record is vetoed.</p>

    <p>Note that you can present the second check - for database fields containing <NULL/> values - on
    a per-form and a per-database basis.<br/>
    For the former, you need to add a boolean property <code>FormsCheckRequiredFields</code> to the form
    (aka the <code>FormController</code>'s model), using its
    <member scope="com::sun::star::beans">XPropertyContainer::addProperty</member> method, with a value
    of <FALSE/>.<br/>
    For the latter, you need to set the respective property of the data source's <code>Settings</code>
    (also named <code>FormsCheckRequiredFields</code>) to <FALSE/>.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can prevent the check on a per-control basis, using the
    <member>DataAwareControlModel::InputRequired</member> property of a single control model.</p>

    <p>If a control which the controller is responsible for supports the <type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XDispatchProviderInterception</type>
    interface, the controller registers a dispatch interceptor. Then, the control can try to delegate part of its
    functionality to the controller by querying the dispatch interceptor for it.</p>

    <p>Below, there's a list of URLs which have a defined meaning - if an implementation supports one of them,
    there must be a guaranteed semantics. However, concrete implementations may support an arbitrary sub or super
    set of these URLs.</p>

    <p>In general, all URLs start with the same prefix, namely <em>.uno:FormController/</em>. To this, a suffix is
    appended which describes the requested functionality.<br/>
    Example: The URL suffix for deleting the current record is <em>deleteRecord</em>, so the complete URL for
    requesting a dispatcher for this functionality is <em>.uno:FormController/deleteRecord</em>.</p>

    <p>Some URLs may require parameters. For this, the sequence of <type scope="com::sun::star::beans">PropertyValue</type>s
    passed to the <member scope="com::sun::star::frame">XDispatch::dispatch</member> call is used - every property value is
    used as one named parameter.</p>

    <p>For all URLs, interested parties can register as status listeners (<type scope="com::sun::star::frame">XStatusListener</type>)
    at the dispatchers, and be notified whenever the functionality associated with the URL becomes enabled or
    disabled.<br/>
    For instance, the URL with the suffix <em>moveToFirst</em> is associated with moving the form to the first
    record, and it will be disabled in case the form is already positioned on the first record.</p>

        The status value which is being notified (<member scope="com::sun::star::frame">FeatureStateEvent::State</member>)
        is a string which can be used to display the record count. In particular, if the record count is not yet known
