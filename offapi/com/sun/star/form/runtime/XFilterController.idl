/** provides access to a form based filter for a database form

    <p>In a form based filter, form controls bound to a searchable database field are replaced with a control
    which allows entering a search expression. This so-called <em>predicate expression</em> is basically a part of an
    SQL <code>WHERE</code> clause, but without the the part denoting the database column. For instance, if you
    have a form control bound to a table column named <code>Name</code>, then entering the string
    <q>LIKE '%Smith%'</q> effectively constitutes a SQL <code>WHERE</code> clause <code>"Name" LIKE '%Smith%'</code>.</p>

    <p>In the actual document view, there are usually some relaxations to this. For instance, keywords such as
    <code>LIKE</code> might be localized, according to OpenOffice.org's UI locale. Also, for an equality criterion,
    the equality sign <code>=</code> is usually omitted. However, this interface here provides programmatic access
    to the form based filter, so those relaxations are not considered here.</p>

    <p>The filter maintained by a filter controller is, logically, a disjunctive normal form of an SQL <code>WHERE</code>
    class. That is, it is a disjunction of <em>m</em> terms, where each term is a conjunction of <em>n</em> clauses
    of the form <code>&lt;column&gt; &lt;predicate&gt; &lt;literal&gt;</code> or of the form <code><em>&lt;column&gt;
    IS [NOT] NULL</em></code>.</p>

    <p><em>n</em> equals the number of filter controls which the filter controller is responsible for. This number
    doesn't change during one session of the form based filter. On the other hand, <em>m</em>, the number of disjunctive
    terms, is dynamic.</p>

    <a name="active_term"></a>
    <p>With the above, there are potentially <em>m * n</em> <em>predicate expressions</em> (though usually only a fraction
    of those will actually exist). Since in a form based filter, there are only <em>n</em> filter controls, and each
    filter control displays exactly one <em>predicate expression</em>, this means that only a part of the complete
    filter can be displayed, in particular, only one <em>disjunctive term</em> can be displayed at a time. Thus,
    the filter controller knows the concept of an <em>active term</em>, denoted by the <member>ActiveTerm</member>
    attribute, controls which of the terms is currently displayed in the form controls.</p>
