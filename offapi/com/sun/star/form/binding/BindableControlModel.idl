        <p>Via this service, bindable control models inherit the

        If an bindable control model, at which a binding has been established (via
        <member>XBindableValue::setValueBinding</member>), is being cloned, then the
        binding is also established at the clone. Effectively, this means that
        both control model instances share the same binding instance.</p>

    /** specifies support for being bound to an external value

        <p>When a <type>BindableControlModel</type> is bound to an external value,
        then every change in the control model's value is <em>immediately</em> reflected
        in the external binding.</p>

        <p>If the binding set via this interface supports the <member>ValueBinding::ReadOnly</member>
        and <member>ValueBinding::Relevant</member> properties, they're respected by the control model:
        <ul><li>The control model's own <code>ReadOnly</code> property (if present) is kept in sync with the
                binding's <code>ReadOnly</code> property. That is, any control using the value
                binding is read-only as long as the binding is.</li>
            <li>The control model's own <code>Enabled</code> property (if present) is kept in sync
                with the binding's <code>Relevant</code> property. That is, any control using
                the value binding is disabled as long as the binding is not relevant.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>In both cases, explicit changes of the model's property are ignored if they would relax
        the restriction imposed by the binding.<br/>
        For instance, if the binding declares it's value to
        be read-only (indicated by <member>ValueBinding::ReadOnly</member> being <TRUE/>), then
        any attempt to set the <code>ReadOnly</code> property of the control model to <FALSE/> will
        fail. However, if the binding's value is not read-only, then the <code>ReadOnly</code>
        property at the control model can be freely set.<br/>
        The very same holds for the binding's <member>ValueBinding::Relevant</member> and the control
        model's <code>Enabled</code> properties.</p>
