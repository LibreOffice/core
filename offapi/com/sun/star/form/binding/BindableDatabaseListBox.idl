/** This service specifies a list box model which is data-aware and thus can be bound to a
    database field, and additionally supports binding to arbitrary external values.

    <p>There are four possible ways how a <type>BindableDatabaseListBox</type> exchanges
    values with an external binding, the following lists explains all of them. If a new binding
    is set at a <type>BindableDatabaseListBox</type>, the types from the following list are
    tried in descending order: The first type supported by the binding is used for data exchange.
    <ol><li><em>sequences of integers</em>: When used, the integers in the sequence will represent
            the indexes of the selected entries of the list box.</li>
        <li><em>integer values</em>: When used, the value will represent the index of the selected entry.
            If no entry is selected, -1 will be transfered. If more than one entry is selected, <NULL/>
            will be transfered.</li>
        <li><em>sequences of strings</em>: When used, the strings in the sequence present the texts
            of the selected entries of the list box.</li>
        <li><em>string values</em>: When used. the value will represent the text of the selected entry.
            If no entry is selected, an empty string will be transfered. If more than one entry is selected,
            <NULL/> will be transfered.</li>
