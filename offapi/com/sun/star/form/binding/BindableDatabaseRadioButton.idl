    database field, and additionally supports binding to arbitrary external values.

    <p>The com::sun::star::form::binding::XValueBinding instance which
    can be associated with a BindableDatabaseRadioButton must support exchanging
    boolean values. The following mapping between external values and control states apply:
    <ul><li>`TRUE` will be mapped to the button being checked, and vice versa</li>
        <li>`FALSE` will be mapped to it being unchecked, and vice versa</li>
        <li>`NULL` will be mapped to it being in undetermined state</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>If the value binding associated with a BindableDatabaseRadioButton
    supports exchanging string values, <em>and</em> the com::sun::star::form::component::RadioButton::RefValue
    is <em>not</em> empty, then the radio button will exchange its value as string:
    <ul><li>A string equal to the reference value will be mapped to the button being checked, and vice versa</li>
        <li>A string not equal to the reference value will be mapped to the button being unchecked, and vice versa</li>
        <li>`NULL` will be mapped to it being in undetermined state</li>
    </ul></p>
