/** This service specifies a check box which is data-aware and thus can be bound to a
    database field, and additionally supports binding to arbitrary external values.

    <p>The <type scope="com::sun::star::form::binding">XValueBinding</type> instance which
    can be associated with a <type>BindableDatabaseCheckBox</type> must support exchanging
    boolean values. The following mapping between external values and control states apply:
    <ul><li><TRUE/> will be mapped to the box being checked, and vice versa</li>
        <li><FALSE/> will be mapped to it being unchecked, and vice versa</li>
        <li><NULL/> will be mapped to it being in undetermined state, if the box currently supports
        this, or being unchecked else. The undetermined of the check box will always be
        mapped to <NULL/> when writing the external value.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <p>If the value binding associated with a <type>BindableDatabaseCheckBox</type>
    supports exchanging string values, <em>and</em> the <member scope="com::sun::star::form::component">CheckBox::RefValue</member>
    is <em>not</em> empty, then the radio button will exchange it's value as string:
    <ul><li>A string equal to the reference value will be mapped to the button being checked, and vice versa</li>
        <li>A string not equal to the reference value will be mapped to the button being unchecked, and vice versa</li>
        <li><NULL/> will be mapped to it being in undetermined state</li>
    </ul></p>
