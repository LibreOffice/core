/** specifies a button control which can execute external submissions

    <p>The model of the control has to support the <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">SubmitButton</type>
    service.</p>

    <p>The control is clickable. When clicked (by mouse or keyboard, or programmatically),
        the following happens:
    <ol><li>Any <type scope="com::sun::star::form::submission">XSubmissionVetoListener</type>s registered
            at the component are given the chance to veto the submission.
        </li>
        <li>The model of the control is examined for an external submission object. That is,
            <member scope="com::sun::star::form::submission">XSubmissionSupplier::getSubmission</member>
            is called at the model.<br/>
            If there is such a submission object, its
            <member scope="com::sun::star::form::submission">XSubmission::submit</member> method is invoked.
        </li>
        <li>If there is no external submission, the parent object of the model is examined
            for the presence of the <type scope="com::sun::star::form">XSubmit</type> interface. If it
            is present, it's <member scope="com::sun::star::form">XSubmit::submit</member> method is
            invoked.<br/>
            Since the parent object of a submit button can only be a <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">Form</type>,
            this means that <type>SubmitButton</type>s are also able to submit <type scope="com::sun::star::form::component">HTMLForm</type>s.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
