/** specifies a button control which can execute external submissions

    <p>The model of the control has to support the com::sun::star::form::component::SubmitButton
    service.</p>

    <p>The control is clickable. When clicked (by mouse or keyboard, or programmatically),
        the following happens:
    <ol><li>Any com::sun::star::form::submission::XSubmissionVetoListeners registered
            at the component are given the chance to veto the submission.
        </li>
        <li>The model of the control is examined for an external submission object. That is,
            com::sun::star::form::submission::XSubmissionSupplier::getSubmission()
            is called at the model.<br/>
            If there is such a submission object, its
            com::sun::star::form::submission::XSubmission::submit() method is invoked.
        </li>
        <li>If there is no external submission, the parent object of the model is examined
            for the presence of the com::sun::star::form::XSubmit interface. If it
            is present, it's com::sun::star::form::XSubmit::submit() method is
            invoked.<br/>
            Since the parent object of a submit button can only be a com::sun::star::form::component::Form,
            this means that SubmitButtons are also able to submit com::sun::star::form::component::HTMLForms.
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
