        <p>Though concrete implementations of the service may offer different sets of aspects which can be customized,
        the following commands have, if supported, a defined meaning:
        <dl>
            <dt>.uno:GridSlots/BrowserAttribs</dt><dd> (interactively) customize the overall appearance of the grid (font etc.)</dd>
            <dt>.uno:GridSlots/RowHeight</dt><dd> (interactively) customize the row height appearance of the grid</dd>
            <dt>.uno:GridSlots/ColumnAttribs</dt><dd> (interactively) customize the format of a given column</dd>
            <dt>.uno:GridSlots/ColumnWidth</dt><dd> (interactively) customize the width of a given column</dd>
        </dl>
        </p>

        <p>The following parameters may be passed when dispatching the commands above (as before, concrete implementations
        may extend this list):
        <dl>
            <dt>ColumnId</dt><dd> the id of the column in question, if the command is executed for a column</dd>
            <dt>ColumnModelPos</dt><dd> the model position of the column in question, if the command is executed for a column</dd>
            <dt>ColumnViewPos</dt><dd> the view position of the column in question, if the command is executed for a column. The
            view position may differ from the model position, as in a grid control, columns can be hidden.</dd>
        </dl>
