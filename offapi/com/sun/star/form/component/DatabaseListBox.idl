/** This service specifies a data-aware list box control model.

    <p>The base service for list boxes (<type>ListBox</type>) offers only
    one possibility to specify the list entries: the <member>ListBox::ListSource</member>
    property, which contains all the strings to be displayed.</p>

    <p>This service here extends this mimic. It allows to fill the list from a data source.
    This means that a second result set is opened, which works on the same connection as the
    form which the list box belongs to, but can be based on an arbitrary table or SQL statement.</p>

    <p>For instance, you may have a form which is bound to a table <em>invoice</em>, and you use it
    to enter invoices for your customers. Probably, you will have a second table (say <em>customer</em>),
    which (among other data) contains a unique key for identifying customers. In your invoice table, you will
    have a foreign key referring to these customers.<br/>
    Now, besides the result set the form is based on (all your invoices), the list box can be caused
    to open a second result set, this time for the <em>customer</em> table, and fill it's list with entries
    from this result set.<br/>
    Additionally, it allows to model the relation between the two tables: When the user selects a customer from
    the list, this customer has the unique id we just talked about (which is not necessarily visible to the
    user in any way). The list box then automatically transfers this id into the foreign key column of
    <em>invoice</em>, thus allowing the user to transparently work with human-readable strings instead of
    pure numbers.<br/>
    Let's call this result set the list is filled from the <em>list result set</em> here ...</p>

    /** specifies which column of the list result set should be used for data exchange.

        <p>When you make a selection from a list box, the "BoundColumn"
        property reflects which column value of a result set should
        be used as the value of the component. If the control is bound
        to a database field, the column value is stored in the
        database field identified by the property

            <dd>The column value of the result set at the position is
            stored in the current database field.</dd>
        </dl></p>

        <p>The bound column property is only used if a list source is defined
        and the list source matches with the types
        <member scope="com::sun::star::form">ListSourceType::TABLE</member>,

        get the column values.</p>
