/** specifies a model for a control which can display form data in a table-like way.

    <p>In opposite to other form controls, grid controls do not only
    display the single current value of a column they are bound to. Moreover, they do
    display not only the current row of the form, but all rows (at least potentially, limited
    by the control size, of course).</p>

    <p>The table rows in a grid control correspond to the rows in the DataForm
    the control belongs to, and the columns correspond to single columns of the form's row set.</p>

    <p>Columns of a grid control are modeled by own objects, too. They are very similar to usual
    com::sun::star::form::DataAwareControlModels modeling other "single-value" controls, but they are not described
    as own services. Instead, they need to be created using the com::sun::star::form::XGridColumnFactory interface.</p>
