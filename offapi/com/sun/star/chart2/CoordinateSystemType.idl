The service CoordinateSystemType represents a special type of coordinate system.
For example a 2 dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is a CoordinateSystemType
and different from for example a 3 dimensional spherical coordinate system.
</p>
<p>A CoordinateSystemType is a stateless service which has no owner and does not
enable cyclic references, thus its lifetime can be handled by reference or it
may be implemented as a singleton.</p>
