    For instance, you could base the report on the SQL statement
    <code>SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE cust_ref = :cid</code>, and add <code>cid</code>
    to the DetailFields property. In this case, the parameter will be filled from
    the corresponding master field.<br/>
    Alternatively, you could simply base your report on the table <code>invoices</code>,
    and add the column name <code>cust_ref</code> to the DetailFields. In this case,
    and implicit filter clause <code>WHERE cust_ref = :&lt;new_param_name&gt;</code> will
    be created, and the artificial parameter will be filled from the corresponding
    master field.<br/>
    If a string in this property denotes both a column name and a parameter name, it
    is undefined which way it is interpreted, but implementations of the service are required
    to either decide for the paramter or the column, and proceed as usual.
