        <p>This is useful, if a XLabeledDataSequence has
        no label sequence.  In this case you can call this method at
        the value sequence to obtain a fitting replacement label.</p>

        <p>The sequence returned here may be empty if no suitable
        label can be generated.</p>

        <p>The strings returned should be localized.</p>

        @param eLabelOrigin
            denotes what part of the range should be used for label
            generation. If you have, e.g., one cell only, the
            parameter COLUMN enables you to get the name of the cell's
            column, the parameter ROW will give you its row name.

            If you have a non quadratic range you can ask for labels for
            the longer side with parameter LONG_SIDE or you can obtain labels
            for the shorter side with parameter SHORT_SIDE.

            If the range is not structured in a tabular way you may receive
            no label.

        @return
            Suitable labels for the given sequence depending on the range
            of the sequence and the parameter <code>eLabelOrigin</code> passed.
            In a spreadsheet this would typically be a label like "Column x"
            for the short side used as DataSeries name and maybe a
            sequence "Row 1" "Row 2" "Row 3" for the long side to be used
            as categories for example.

        Example: Assuming this sequence has a Range representation spanning
        row 5 and 6 in column 8. Following sequences of strings or similar strings
        are expected as return values:

        generateLabel( SHORT_SIDE ) -> "Column 8"
        generateLabel( LONG_SIDE )  -> "Row 5" "Row 6"
        generateLabel( COLUMN )     -> "Column 8"
        generateLabel( ROW )        -> "Row 5" "Row 6"

        Which strings exactly you return depends on the naming scheme of the application
        which provides its tabular data.
