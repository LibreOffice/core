        component that implements XDataProvider and gets
        this property as argument to
        XDataProvider::detectArguments().</p>

        <p>The representation string is of a form that may be used in the
        user interface.  Example for OOo Calc: "$Sheet1.$A$1:$D$7",
        example for OOo Writer: "&lt;Table1.A1:D7&gt;".</p>

        rows depending on the property
        #DataRowSource.</p>

        <p>When used as output of
        XDataProvider::detectArguments() this is the
        range that spans the ranges of all given
        XDataSequences.  If the result is ambiguous,
        i.e., a splitting of this range would not yield the same
        result, this property should be empty.  The latter is the
        case, when ranges are overlapping, the lengths of sequences
        are not equal or even if the order of two sequences is swapped
        (e.g. data comes from column A, C, B).</p>
