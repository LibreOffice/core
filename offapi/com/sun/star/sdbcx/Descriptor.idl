    A descriptor is commonly created by the container of a specific object, such as, tables or views.
    After the creation of the descriptor the properties have to be filled.
    Afterwards, you append the descriptor to the container and the container creates a new object based
    on the informations of the descriptor. The descriptor can be used to create serveral objects.

    <p>
    A descriptor containes at least the informations of the name of an object.
