<p>
    This service is optional for each driver. Its purpose is to define
    a common way for database definition, as the DDL differs between most DBMS.
</p>
<p>
    Definition and deletion of database catalogs can't be defined in a common
    manner for DBMS, but it should be possible to hide much of the complexity
    of creation and deletion of catalogs. Each driver could provide methods to
    cover these tasks.
