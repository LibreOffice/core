    /** Called by a data consumer to obtain a system specific data object from the
        source.
        The data object is returned in an any. The contained type may differ on
        different platforms.
        The argument aProcessId contains a process identifier of the caller's process.
        The process ID can be obtained by the C function rtl_getGlobalProcessId
        (rtl/process.h).
        The interface implementation must ensure that the system data object can be
        used in that process. If the data object is not valid in the caller' process
        than the returned any must be empty.

        Windows: The returned any contains an unsigned long which represents a pointer to
        an IDataObject interface. The caller of getData has to release the data
        object (IDataObject::Release) if it is no longer needed.
        The caller must make sure that the current thread has been initialized for
        OLE ( OleInitialize).

        @returns
        the system dependent data object.
