    /** Called by a data consumer to obtain a system specific data object from the
        source.
        The data object is returned in an any. The contained type may differ on
        different platforms.

        @param aProcessId
        The argument aProcessId is a process identifier of the caller's process.
        The interface implementation must ensure that the system data object can be
        used in that process. If the data object is not valid in the caller process
        then the returned any must be empty.

        @returns
        The system dependent data object.

        <br/><br/><p><strong>Notes:</strong>Under Windows the returned any contains an unsigned long which represents a pointer to
        an IDataObject interface. The caller of getData has to release the data
        object (IDataObject::Release) if it is no longer needed.
        The caller must also make sure that the current thread has been initialized for
        OLE (use OleInitialize).</p>
