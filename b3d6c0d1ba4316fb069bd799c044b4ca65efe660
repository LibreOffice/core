      "message": "I\u0027m not sure anyone can really understand the interaction of m_pCurrentCursor and especial how it intersects with IsTableMode.\n\nI allowed a few silly mistakes as I was developing this, and was happy that each one proved to hit a unit test failure. (The first was m_pCurrentCursor \u003d GetNext() instead of GetPrev().  The other was ignoring when TableMode passed its Cursor.)\n\nm_pCurrentCursor must always be valid. I saw a few dynamic_casts, but compiling didn\u0027t allow those to be changed to static_cast. TableMode fails the dynamic_cast these, so that is how I avoided the situation.\n\nIn this reverse-cell-select, the very first item was a bDel of pCurrentCursor, so changing to GetPrev() goes to the end of the loop - the last item. That for sure will not be bDel, so that solves the major false-selection problem in tables.\n\n",
