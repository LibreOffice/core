      "message": "Let me describe ~all that I find wrong with this change. It relates to your patches in general.\n\nThe patch is filled with unrelated stuff.\n1. You change inclusion guards with pragma once.\n2. You re-arrange includes \"while you are here\".\n3. When I told you that you used some non-\"standard\" footer string *for new file*, you changed it in *existing files*.\n4. You regenerated pch.\n\n1, 2, and 4 are nice by themselves. Yet, they *must* be separate. I already told you that; and you reply about how you did that *always*. OK, I simply can\u0027t review changes that don\u0027t allow me e.g. to easily see what inclusions were *added* for the sake of functional change - just because many headers were re-arranged, and I need to check if this header is new or moved. I can\u0027t just use the diff to see the places that were changed functionally - because there are + and - related to cosmetics like pragmas.\n\n3 is wrong. The existing files need no such change - at least I never saw commits that replaced the bottom line in existing files. As said, I don\u0027t even know what the string defines, and why the reference line for new files was changed ...\n\nAny cosmetic changes must be in separate dedicated commits. I simply refuse to review commits that fail that. Sorry.",

      "message": "1. Can\u0027t see why that is so bad. Are you seriously saying that is a problem? You seriously want me to generate a new build to change this? Fine.\n2. That\u0027s because I was adding the sal/config.h - which you told me to do\n3. That \"non-standard\" modeline is in almost all of our existing files. You don\u0027t like the non-standard modeline footer, but then you complain you don\u0027t want non-standard footers? Make up your mind. \n4. I regenerated the PCH files because I introduced a new header. What is the issue with this?\n\nIf you don\u0027t know what a vi modeline does, then why are you telling me to change it?!?",
