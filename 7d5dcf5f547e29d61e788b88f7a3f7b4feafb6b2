      "message": "No, thank *you* for fixing that original bug; this was just a small leftover from the bigger improvement :) The only thing that I\u0027m unsure is if it\u0027s safe to use pObjData-\u003emaStart unconditionally as I made it - as I mentioned in the commit message, and also in https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/108377/3#message-f8c00e0ee3dc3067552651a4da9a3633ec455062. Well, if it regresses, the fix would be obvious 😊\n\nActually, I was thinking yesterday how lucky we were that *you* also added that unit test in the other commit that allowed to repro reliably on my system. The unit test was 99% of success in fixing this - again, thank you!",
