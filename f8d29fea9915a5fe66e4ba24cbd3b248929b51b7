      "message": "Is this correct? I mean, if the shape had no \"snap rectangle\" previously (it was empty) and now we get a new one, then I would assume that new snap rectangle is exactly rRect. OK, the style here is to not set it directly, but go via resize and move, but still, I would expect a fraction here which is rRect.getWidth() / 1 for aX. Same for aY. And for the size, I would expect it only depends on rRect, not aOld, since it\u0027s empty, so calling Left() or Top() on it returns 0 anyway.\n\nOr do I miss something? Thanks.",

      "message": "I would tend to agree that what you say makes sense, but....\n\nThis piece of logic lower down:\n    if ( nDivX \u003d\u003d 0 ) { nMulX \u003d 1; nDivX \u003d 1; }\n    if ( nDivY \u003d\u003d 0 ) { nMulY \u003d 1; nDivY \u003d 1; }\nSeems to indicate that the prior intention was to keep the same size if the old rect was empty.\n\nProposal for improvement here:\n   https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/111097",
