      "message": "again: why the inversion of the parameter here ?\nnStartPos is a uint16 index in liste. nNewEnd is a position in string...\nyou can\u0027t just swap them around like that\n\nPS: I stopped the review there... I mentioned that particular problem earlier, you silently ignored it in a new version... I\u0027m not inclined to have to do a full review every time...",

      "message": "sorry, I must have missed your answer...\nnonetheless. you cannot change the order of the argument without adjusting the caller.\nhere the prototype was \u0027wrong\u0027 (when you look at the caller), but since both argument had the same type it did not have any impact. note the variable name in the prototype are decorative... and have no semantic impact.\n\nsee line 1586 (as indicated originally)\nthe caller pass: HTMLSttPos*,  sal_Int32 and sal_uInt16\nYou prolly have some warning there with this patch (implicit downcast of a signed 32 bits into an unsigned 16 bit)",
