We just want to print this OSL_FAIL out thus:\n\nif (mpDialogParent \u0026\u0026 mpDialogParent-\u003eIsDisposed())\n   OSL_FAIL(...);\n\nin fact - it would prolly be better to have a plain assert here:\n\nassert (!mpDialogParent || !mpDialogParent-\u003eIsDisposed());\n\n? \u003d) We don\u0027t want to clear the pointer that is an object member and we need to keep our parentage around. Clearing a local variable, or deletion tag - is very different to zeroing a critical member \u003d)",
