      "message": "Allow me to tell you the whole history.\nStarmath isn\u0027t fully compatible with mathml.\nSo we are creating a \"starmath 6\" wich is compatible with it.\nIn order to do so we have introudced an SmMlElement type of node.\nAnd we have added a SmMLImport / SmMLExport.\nHohwever, given that starmath isn\u0027t fully compatible with mathml\nand the new version is, obviously the backguards compatibility fails.\nSo we can\u0027t update documents automatically (user manually).\nThere the need of the new SmMLExportWrapper / SmMLImportWrapper.\nThose will load and write the documents with they\u0027re specific version ( 5 or 6 ).\nSo this change won\u0027t have any effects on the old documents.\nThat functionality is blocked for the users by now.\nAnd if by interoperability you mean the other office editor\u0027s I heard that they use the mathml code in content.xml. So also is fine.\nI hope this answers your question.",
