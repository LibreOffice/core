We can\u0027t guarantee that future code won\u0027t use DockingManager::EndPopupMode, or even FloatingWindow::EndPopupMode directly.\n2) It\u0027s never called if the color picker is closed by clicking outside it (not by selecting a color).",

      "message": "1) Oh yes, if I pull in your change, that\u0027s one more place which breaks UNO API compatibility. But that looks a bit more complicated, suppressing UNO callbacks there means even framework doesn\u0027t get callbacks and the UI is not working properly. Need to address that at some stage. :-(\n\n2) Moving the suppress down to FloatingWindow is a good idea, I think we have the same problem with non-gtk3 menus as well, and having the suppress in FloatingWindow would address that as well.",
