When it reads the created string, convert it to css::util::DateTime structure;\n3. Check that the structure is timezoned;\n4. Check that its value is between the time when the check is done, and the time stored at step #1.\n\nAlso another unit test is needed, that would open and save a OOXML document, without the conversion, and we need to check that the creation time string is still timezoned and doesn\u0027t change.",
