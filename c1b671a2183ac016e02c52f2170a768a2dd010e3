      "message": "Such a comment discussing what a commit changes (\"is now here\") is IMO more confusing than helpful for a reader of the resulting code.  I would drop it completely (the resulting code isn\u0027t non-obvious---what was non-obvious was why the commit moved the mutex around rather than just replacing osl::Mutex with std::mutex, and the commit message is the perfect place to document that).",
