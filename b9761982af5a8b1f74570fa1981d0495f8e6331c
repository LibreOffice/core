It sounds like:\n\n1) You confused bytes (4 characters in UTF8) and bits.\n2) You forgot the terminating NULL.\n\nThe string \"UTF8\" takes *5* bytes of storage.\n\nI recommend to let the compiler handle this automatically:\n\nconst char sCharset[] \u003d \"UTF8\";",

      "message": "I\u0027m not really sure it\u0027s better. Considering performance, it\u0027s truly faster, but I think performance aspect is negligible this time, because it\u0027s a one time call for a database connection, with max 100 characters.\n\nThe more important aspect is readablilty. In my version the developer doesn\u0027t have to care about terminating null, there is only a function call. But is doesn\u0027t really matter too.",
