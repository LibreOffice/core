      "message": "Hi Julien; if you wrote the code there yourself - and/or it was written by you and others listed in the Developers page who have assignments - then sure, it\u0027s best practice to use the smaller header (easier to read too \u003d) Thanks for the cleanup. If it is/was based on code that came from AOO - then we need the longer header.",
