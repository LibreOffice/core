But building the https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/134761 with all the chained dependency commits, I try NVDA on my Windows, and do not hear the names of the elements - no matter if I hover over using mouse, or click in the elements.\n\nI am completely noob in a11y, so obviously I do stupid things in a trained monkey way. Appreciate any pointers! Thank you.",
