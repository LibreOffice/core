      "message": "That\u0027s the problem of your icon scaling. You\u0027re lying about the DPI value, so scaling is wrong.\n\nYou can test this with QT_SCALE_FACTOR\u003d1.5 so -env:UserInstallation\u003dfile:///tmp/qt5 --writer and breeze_svg. You should get a folder /tmp/qt5/cache/breeze_svg/150, but you get 100. So the output is a scaled pixmap.",

      "message": "Yes, but my understanding is that this is intended in LO. Scaling is done by the VCL plugins, and the upper layers are supposed to work transparently. Setting this value to the real DPI value results in scaling done twice. Isn\u0027t this happening to you?\nI checked and in my system GTK has the same behavior: it returns 96 and the result is bad icons.",
