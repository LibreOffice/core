      "message": "By using the SVP plugin we use VCL to do bitmap software rendering, which can\u0027t use OpenGL, as it doesn\u0027t rely on any GUI; at least that\u0027s my outlined plan.\n\nFor CppunitTest we already have two macros for a test to declare they need real windows; probably for OpenGL, OpenCL, or if a test want to explicitly test \"real\" GUI functions.",

      "message": "While hacking on the OSX backend I found that\u0027s not to be true. I removed the  VCL_HIDE_WINDOWS environment variable, which acted on Windows and OSX like an SVP plugin behaviour, without having an SVP plugin..\n\nOn OSX I\u0027m working on an additional patch to implement SVP / bitmap rendering in software using the new interface defined in the other patch, where I added you as a reviewer, which was thought more of a FYI, then a real review request.\n\nI tried running a JunitTest via SSH on OSX, which failed due to a blocked event processing function deep in some system code. This still happend after I dropped NSWindow usage. So I found that the SVP plugin wasn\u0027t set and probably I missed the place it should be set. I tested Linux, which runs JunitTest correctly with SVP and so do the other platforms AFAIK",
