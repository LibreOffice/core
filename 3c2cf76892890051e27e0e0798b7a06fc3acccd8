      "message": "But the function sign. is void checkValueAA(BitmapScopedWriteAccess\u0026 pAccess, int x, int y, ...); and it seems the you are not reversing the GetPixel and SetPixel, which actually have the y and x reversed in the function signature. \n\nAnd you are setting here y,x, which is not what is expected by the function signature... so something is reversed or even double reversed, so it makes it correct in the end. Can you try to change the bitmap width and height to not be equal (which is one of the goals to make things non-symmetrical anyway) and see if it will crash...",

      "message": "I\u0027ve tried changing the width and height and the test result was quirky. Also, I added the coordinates in the std::map in (x,y) [where x \u003d 0...width-1, y \u003d 0...height-1] manner which I later used in the main loop for checking if the coordinate is painted or not and passed it to checkValue as (y,x) since, the checkValue method would evaluate it in reverse order for ex:- it does \"pAccess-\u003eSetPixel(y, x, COL_LIGHTGREEN)\" but since the checkValue\u0027s signature is in the order (int x,int y), I think changing the provided coordinates to (y,x) manner or loop variables will do or if it wouldn\u0027t what is it that I\u0027m missing?
