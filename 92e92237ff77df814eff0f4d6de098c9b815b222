For now it applies just the one test color, though the window color has not much effect on the UI.\n\nI wonder if we should merge vcl/source/app/settings (colors) into svtool/colorcfg (out of my skills). And for later, if accepted, we should perhaps put the color categories into a dropdown as the list grows significantly with the application colors. And the workflow with init/apply/okay/cancel is not really consistent, but that\u0027s a different topic.",
