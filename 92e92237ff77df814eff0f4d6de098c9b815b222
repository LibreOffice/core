      "message": "Caolan, what do you think about this approach? For now it applies just the one test color, though the window color has not much effect on the UI.\n\nI wonder if we should merge vcl/source/app/settings (colors) into svtool/colorcfg (out of my skills). And for later, if accepted, we should perhaps put the color categories into a dropdown as the list grows significantly with the application colors. And the workflow with init/apply/okay/cancel is not really consistent, but that\u0027s a different topic.",

      "message": "Sure, it\u0027s kind of a workaround to fix bug 118320 (Windows) and bug 118017 (macOS). But is not so clear how to read the values from both OS under all conditions. And the customization is cheap, the clutter is limited to one list that has a good length right now, and allows tweaking the UI beyond the system theming. I believe many users would love to see LibreOffice being customizable like Firefox, for example, ideally per extension.\nThe missing dark mode support is mentioned most often in surveys and other comments on usability.",
