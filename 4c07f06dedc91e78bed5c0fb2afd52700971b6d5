      "message": "I see the idea. However, I do *not* see how the asserts help programmer, or make anything more correct. If there\u0027s some code that asks if a *random* value is e.g. ascii, it doesn\u0027t make the code more correct if the programmer made a previous call to check that it\u0027s correct Unicode. The outer code would only become incorrect when the programmer does something in \"not ascii\" case, assuming it\u0027s correct Unicode; but then, it\u0027s the other code in fictional \"else\" branch that is incorrect, not the check itself.\n\nI see these asserts just wrong, making any unchecked use of *checks* on user-supplied data wrong, and thus making use of the functions unnecessarily complicated, verbose, and resulting code more difficult to follow.",
