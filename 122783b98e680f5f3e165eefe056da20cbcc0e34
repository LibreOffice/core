What is the directory which is missing from the include path?\n\nIdeally .cxx files have their perfect include path all the time, since we just look up the compile command from compile_commands.json. Perhaps you did an incremental build and forgot to re-run \u0027make vim-ide-integration\u0027?\n\nThis sounds like a workaround for some problem, where it would be better to understand what is the root cause.",
