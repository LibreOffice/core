      "message": "Without changing the direction ( line 481 ), nXAdvance is the width of the character instead of its height. On the other hand, nYAdvance is 0 since it is LTR (horizontal). Simply swapping nXAdvance and nYAdvance doesn\u0027t work since they don\u0027t have the right value.\nI\u0027ve tried to change text direction ( line 481 ) to HB_DIRECTION_TTB (TTB means top to bottom), but all the values between 561 and 564 become zero. It\u0027s pity that HB_DIRECTION_TTB doesn\u0027t work out as my expectation. Hence I overwrite nXAdvance with nVirtAdv.",
