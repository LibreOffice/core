      "message": "hmmm.... actually in this case, the unique_ptr looks unnecessary - the class has only 2 OUString members which are rather like a shared_ptr in behavior, so just copying the instances on vector resizes should work fine and not cause performance trouble (this filter list probably has 100 entries or so in practice).",
