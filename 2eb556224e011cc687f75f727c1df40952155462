      "message": "confirmed that chapter numbering is the problem.\nOn initial load, it is aPreventUseAsChapterNumbering because there is an inheriting paraStyle.\nOn round trip, it is aPreventUseAsChapterNumbering because of a mismatch between outlineLevel and listLevel (which this patch \"breaks\" by putting in the correct listLevel). This second one \"just happens\" to help out in this situation. In the DOCX case, it is prevented because of no pStyle in the abstract numbering. There must be SOME way to identify the same thing in DOC, but I don\u0027t know what that is. It isn\u0027t very clear at all in DOC import.",
