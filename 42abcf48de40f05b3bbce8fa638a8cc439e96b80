      "message": "1. The title your submission is: \"extract match functions from FindFontFamilyByAttributes\", but this patch also modifies the behavior so that the test case testShouldNotFindOtherStyleFamily() no longer passes. I think this change should be done in a separate patch, possibly here:\nhttps://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/123310\n2. You have changed the formatting in a lot of places that you were not otherwise modifying. This causes trouble for following the changes in the git history. I have reverted back each of these changes manually, and this took a lot of time. Please don\u0027t do that.",
