# Paperless — working notes

Paperless is a **pure C# / .NET** library set for content extraction and headless
rendering of the file formats LibreOffice's Writer, Calc and Impress support.

It lives in the `dotnet/` subdirectory of a LibreOffice source checkout. The surrounding
C++ tree is **reference material, not a build dependency** — we read it to learn how the
formats behave, and we run an installed `soffice` to generate ground truth.

## Scope

**In scope.** Word processing (`docx docm dotx dotm doc dot rtf odt ott fodt`),
spreadsheets (`xlsx xlsm xltx xltm xlsb xls xlt ods ots fods csv`), presentations
(`pptx pptm potx potm ppsx ppsm ppt pot pps odp otp fodp`), plus the legacy
OpenOffice.org 1.x forms (`sxw sxc sxi`).

**Out of scope.** Draw, Math and Base. Do not add them. Also: writing/export of any
format (Paperless reads), macro execution (never — Paperless only reports that macros are
*present*), and editing.

## Absolute rules

1. **Never build the C++ tree.** It takes hours and is never needed. Use an installed
   `soffice` for reference output — see the `libreoffice-reference` skill.
2. **Never execute macros.** Macro-enabled formats are read as data. `CanCarryMacros` on
   `FormatInfo` exists so callers can surface the risk; nothing executes.
3. **Rasterise with SkiaSharp, shape with HarfBuzzSharp.** HarfBuzz is what LibreOffice
   shapes with, so advance widths agree by construction. Font metrics come from a
   hand-rolled OpenType reader in `Paperless.Text` — matching LibreOffice's line heights
   needs raw `hhea`/`OS/2` access and our own precedence rules. Before adding any graphics
   dependency, read the note at the top of `Directory.Packages.props`.
4. **Detect formats by content, never by extension.** Mislabelled files are common, and
   some distinctions (DOCX vs DOCM, which application owns an OLE2 file) cannot be made
   from a name at all. The extension is a tie-breaker hint only.
5. **Be lenient when reading.** Real files violate their own specifications constantly.
   Repair what you can, skip what you cannot, record it as a `Diagnostic`. Reserve
   exceptions for genuinely unreadable input.
6. **Zero build warnings.** `TreatWarningsAsErrors` is on solution-wide. Keep it that way.

### Dependency layering

Arrows point at dependencies. Nothing may point back up.

**`Paperless.Core` has no external dependencies and must stay that way.** It holds the
abstractions everything else agrees on: units, geometry, colour, the format catalogue, the
document model, and the drawing IR. A dependency added here is inherited by every
consumer.

## Key design decisions, and why

**All lengths are EMUs, in a `Length` struct.** 914400 per inch divides evenly by twips
(the DOC/DOCX/RTF unit), 1/100 mm (the ODF and draw-layer unit), and points. Storing a
single exact integer avoids the rounding drift that accumulates when converting through
`double` at every boundary.

**Extraction and rendering are separate paths.** `IDocument` gives you content;
`IPaginatedDocument.Layout()` is a distinct, deferred step. Extraction is the common case
and must not pay for fonts, layout or a rasteriser — it costs a small fraction of
rendering.

**One drawing IR, `IDrawingSink`.** Modelled on LibreOffice's `GDIMetaFile`/`MetaAction`
display list and its `drawinglayer` primitives, because those are the two chokepoints all
LibreOffice output passes through — so anything a supported document can express fits
through them. Coordinates stay resolution-independent; text stays glyph runs rather than
outlines so PDF output can be real searchable text.

**One content tree for all three families.** Callers indexing a mixed corpus want text,
tables and structure without branching on whether a file was a deck or a spreadsheet.

**Shared infrastructure is factored by what the formats actually share**, not by
tidiness: Escher/MS-ODRAW is one library because DOC, XLS and PPT all delegate their
drawings to it, so implementing it once buys shapes in all three.

## Fidelity: the thing that will bite you

**Rendering errors cascade.** One wrong measurement — a font metric, a margin, a line
break — shifts everything after it, so a single bug manufactures hundreds of unrelated-
looking failures across a corpus. Fix cascades before anything else; they are cheap to fix
and expensive to work around.

The three highest-risk areas, in order:

1. **Font resolution and metrics.** A substitution that is not metric-compatible changes
   advance widths, hence line breaks, hence pagination. The machine must have Carlito and
   Caladea installed (`fc-match Calibri` → `Carlito`) or every OOXML comparison is
   meaningless. Line height derivation from hhea vs OS/2 metrics has specific precedence
   rules — see `research/06-rendering.md` section B.
2. **DrawingML theme colour resolution.** Get the `lumMod`/`shade`/`tint` chain wrong and
   every themed shape on every slide is the wrong colour at once.
3. **Vector import (WMF/EMF/EMF+).** Full support is committed and there is no C# prior
   art — roughly fifty EMF+ record types alone. Real `.pptx` and `.docx` files embed these
   constantly, so this is the largest single body of work in the project rather than a
   tail-end detail. Port from LibreOffice's `emfio/`. SVG is the exception: it reuses
   `Svg.SceneGraph`/`Svg.Model`, translated from `ShimSkiaSharp`'s command list into
   `IDrawingSink`.

## Workflow

```bash
cd dotnet
dotnet build Paperless.slnx          # must stay warning-free
dotnet test  Paperless.slnx
```

The comparison tests in `tests/Paperless.Fidelity.Tests` need an installed LibreOffice and
skip with a reason when it is missing, so a bare `dotnet test` on a fresh container passes
while quietly covering nothing. Run `check-env.sh` below before trusting a green run.

Comparing against LibreOffice — use the skills, they encode hard-won details:

| Skill | Use for |
|---|---|
| `libreoffice-reference` | Generating reference PDFs, page PNGs and text with headless `soffice` |
| `render-comparison` | Comparing renderings and diagnosing *why* they differ |
| `extraction-comparison` | Comparing extracted text; also the right first step for a visual bug |
| `paperless-corpus` | Building and curating test documents |

Verify the environment before trusting any comparison:

```bash
.claude/skills/libreoffice-reference/scripts/check-env.sh
```

## Research notes

Written from a deep read of the C++ implementation. Consult the relevant one *before*
implementing an area — they contain exact record layouts, algorithms and file:line
citations, and will save far more time than they cost to read.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `research/01-formats-and-detection.md` | The filter/type registry; the detection algorithm with concrete signatures |
| `research/02-writer.md` | Writer's document model, layout engine, and the DOCX/DOC/RTF/ODT importers |
| `research/03-calc.md` | Calc's cell storage, formula engine, importers, and print pagination |
| `research/04-impress.md` | The shape model, custom-shape geometry, PPTX/PPT/ODP importers, slide rendering |
| `research/05-infrastructure.md` | OLE2/CFB byte layouts, ZIP/OPC/ODF packaging, encryption, EditEngine, item sets, encodings |
| `research/06-rendering.md` | VCL output, fonts and metrics, drawinglayer primitives, PDF export, headless entry points |

## Conventions

- British spelling in identifiers and prose (`Colour`, `normalise`) — consistent with the
  existing code.
- XML doc comments on public API. Say *why*, not just what; the what is usually evident
  from the signature.
- Avoid the name `Path` for new types: it collides with `System.IO.Path` under implicit
  usings. The geometry type is `GraphicsPath`.
- Prefer `readonly record struct` for small value types, `sealed record` for immutable
  reference types.
- `Span`/`ReadOnlySpan` for binary parsing hot paths. `AllowUnsafeBlocks` is on.
