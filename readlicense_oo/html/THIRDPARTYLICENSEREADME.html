[*] The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the
&quot;src&quot; and &quot;pixman&quot; directories of the cairo
source distribution. There are other components of the cairo source
distribution (such as the &quot;test&quot; and &quot;perf&quot;) that
are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the source code in these
directories contributes to a build of the cairo library itself,
(libcairo.so or cairo.dll or similar).</P>

These auxilary components are also free software, but may be under
different license terms than cairo itself. For example, most of the
test cases in the perf and test directories are made available under
a MIT license to simplify any use of this code for reference purposes
in using cairo itself. Other files might be available under the GNU
General Public License (GPL), for example. Again, please see the

ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter
Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises
of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright
and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the
Free Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source
code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full
details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any
program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more

The Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with
GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is
freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts
(config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support
script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely
distributable.</P>

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is
covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence
arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or
more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has
been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding
provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is
unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as
we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF
files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading
support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been
simplified to produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique
does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger
than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.</P>

The above mentioned file should become obsolete, and the author of
the original file should preferably modify this file instead.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Modifications were needed in order to support native UTF-8 engines,
but functionality (hopefully) didn't change in any way, at least not
intentionally. This file is no longer stand-alone; at least for 8-bit
engines you probably want to use loadhyph-foo.tex (which will load
this file) instead.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Modifications were done by Jonathan Kew, Mojca Miklavec &amp; Arthur
Reutenauer with help &amp; support from: - Karl Berry, who gave us
free hands and all resources - Taco Hoekwater, with useful macros -
Hans Hagen, who did the unicodifisation of patterns already long
before and helped with testing, suggestions and bug reports - Norbert
Preining, who tested &amp; integrated patterns into TeX Live</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
However, the &quot;copyright/copyleft&quot; owner of patterns remains
the original author.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The copyright statement of this file is thus:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Do with this file whatever needs to be done in future for the sake of
&quot;a better world&quot; as long as you respect the copyright of
original file. If you're the original author of patterns or taking
over a new revolution, please remove all of the TUG comments &amp;
credits that we added here - you are the Queen / the King, we are
only the servants.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
If you want to change this file, rather than uploading directly to
CTAN, we would be grateful if you could send it to us
(<A HREF="http://tug.org/tex-hyphen">http://tug.org/tex-hyphen</A>)
or ask for credentials for SVN repository and commit it yourself; we
will then upload the whole &quot;package&quot; to CTAN.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Before a new &quot;pattern-revolution&quot; starts, please try to
follow some guidelines if possible:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
- \lccode is *forbidden*, and I really mean it - all the patterns
should be in UTF-8 - the only &quot;allowed&quot; TeX commands in
this file are: \patterns, \hyphenation, and if you really cannot do
without, also \input and \message - in particular, please no \catcode
or \lccode changes, they belong to loadhyph-foo.tex, and no
\lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin, they have no influence here and
belong elsewhere - \begingroup and/or \endinput is not needed - feel
free to do whatever you want inside comments</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
We know that TeX is extremely powerful, but give a stupid parser at
least a chance to read your patterns.</P>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&gt; I was wondering what the copyright status of your &quot;UK English</SPAN>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&gt; be lacking any copyright notice.</SPAN>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">There were many many sources in total, but any text marked</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">&quot;copyright&quot; was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public</SPAN>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100</SPAN>

&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
documentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of
each subsequent Contributor:</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
i) changes to the Program, and</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
ii) additions to the Program;</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
derivative works of the Program.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes
the Program.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&quot;Licensed Patents &quot; mean patent claims licensable by a
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance
with this Agreement.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under
this Agreement, including all Contributors.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
object code form.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
licensed hereunder.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights
and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
distributing the Program.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
3. REQUIREMENTS</P>

form under its own license agreement, provided that:</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
b) its license agreement:</P>

and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use
of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees
to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified
Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs
(collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and
other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual
or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify,
an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor must pay those damages.</P>

Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.</P>

and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any
licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
and survive.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about
whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the
better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the
explanations below.</P>

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,

you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and

pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you
can do these things.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
these rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or
if you modify it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we
gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. If you link other code with the library, you must
provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can
relink them with the library after making changes to the library and
recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified
by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what
they have is not the original version, so that the original author's
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced
by others.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary
General Public License. It also provides other free software
developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public
License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must
be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library,
whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
<STRONG>0.</STRONG> This License Agreement applies to any software
library or other program which contains a notice placed by the
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License
(also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as
&quot;you&quot;.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
executables.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work
based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the library.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output
from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work
based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool
for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library
does and what the program that uses the Library does.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
<STRONG>1.</STRONG> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of
the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence
of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
<STRONG>2.</STRONG> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library
or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">

	License.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	<STRONG>d)</STRONG> If a facility in the modified Library refers to
	a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application
	program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed
	when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
	to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
	function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
	whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.</P>
	<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
	purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
	application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
	application-supplied function or table used by this function must be
	optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
	function must still compute square roots.)</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
<STRONG>3.</STRONG> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary
GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to
this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public
License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version
than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do
not make any other change in these notices.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
Library into a program that is not a library.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
<STRONG>4.</STRONG> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a
portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or
executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided
that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
<STRONG>5.</STRONG> A program that contains no derivative of any
portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by
being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses
the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work
that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such
executables.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work
may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code
is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work
can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a
library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined
by law.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions
(ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
will still fall under Section 6.)</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
<STRONG>6.</STRONG> As an exception to the Sections above, you may
also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with
the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and
distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the
terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.</P>
<H2 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="preamble1"></A>Preamble</H2>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software
Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our
software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
freedom of others.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</P>

Definitions.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to
other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed
under this License. Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.
&ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be
individuals or organizations.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or
part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other
than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a
&ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the earlier work or a work &ldquo;based
on&rdquo; the earlier work.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or a
work based on the Program.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that,
without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that
enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction
with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
is not conveying.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal
Notices&rdquo; to the extent that it includes a convenient and
prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user
commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list
meets this criterion.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="section13"></A>1. Source
Code.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of
the work for making modifications to it. &ldquo;Object code&rdquo;
means any non-source form of a work.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is
an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
language.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include
anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the
normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of
that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work
with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for
which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major
essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs,
or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter
used to run it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code form
means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an
executable work) run the object code and to modify the work,
including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not
include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For
example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="section22"></A>2. Basic
Permissions.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of
having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply
with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the
covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under
your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making
any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
with you.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</P>

Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,
against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="section42"></A>4. Conveying
Verbatim Copies.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</P>

Modified Source Versions.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
	it, and giving a relevant date.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released

	requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &ldquo;keep
	intact all notices&rdquo;.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
	to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
	therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
	terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
	how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
	the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
	permission if you have separately received it.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
	Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
	interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
	need not make them do so.</P>
</UL>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting
copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</P>

Non-Source Forms.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product

	used for software interchange.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
	(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
	offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
	offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to
	give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
	Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
	covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
	used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
	reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,

	at no charge.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
	written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative

	received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
	subsection 6b.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
	d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
	(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
	Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
	further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
	Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
	copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
	may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that
	supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear
	directions next to the object code saying where to find the
	Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
	Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
	available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</P>
	<LI><P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">

A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer
product&rdquo;, which means any tangible personal property which is
normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2)
anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In
determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases
shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product
received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to
a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the
status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular
user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such
uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any
methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information
required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work
in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
interfered with solely because modification has been made.</P>

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &ldquo;further
restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program
as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the

where to find the applicable terms.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">

Termination.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</P>

Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="section101"></A>10.
Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring
control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or
subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation
of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to
that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives
whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had
or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with
reasonable efforts.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
of it.</P>

Patents.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use
under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is
based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
&ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent
claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
contributor version. For purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo;
includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent
with the requirements of this License.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is
any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent
or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To &ldquo;grant&rdquo;
such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be
so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of
the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
the patent license to downstream recipients. &ldquo;Knowingly
relying&rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the
patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your
recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one
or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to
believe are valid.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent
license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the
covered work and works based on it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not
include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,
or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights
that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey
a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from
you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of
the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies),
or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into
that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
March 2007.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</P>

Surrender of Others' Freedom.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you
could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
entirely from conveying the Program.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="section131"></A>13. Use
with the GNU Affero General Public License.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of
this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public
License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will
apply to the combination as such.</P>
<H3 LANG="en-US" CLASS="western"><A NAME="section14"></A>14. Revised
Versions of this License.</H3>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes
you to choose that version for the Program.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any

later version.</P>

<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License
is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it
to your programs, too.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these
things.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.3cm; margin-bottom: 0.3cm">
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making
the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed
at all.</P>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">PREAMBLE</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">========</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">unrelated to TeX.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">who are considering distributing their works under this license.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">that work may be distributed.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.</SPAN>


<SPAN LANG="en-US">DEFINITIONS</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">===========</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">In this license document the following terms are used:</SPAN>

   <SPAN LANG="en-US">`Work'</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">Any work being distributed under this License.</SPAN>
    
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">`Derived Work'</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.</SPAN>

   <SPAN LANG="en-US">`Modification' </SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">law -- for example, the production of a file containing an</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">translated into another language.</SPAN>

   <SPAN LANG="en-US">`Modify'</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">applicable law.</SPAN>
    
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">`Distribution'</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">making any electronic components of the Work accessible by</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).</SPAN>

   <SPAN LANG="en-US">`Compiled Work'</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">include using installation facilities provided by the Work,</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">other activities.  Note that modification of any installation</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.</SPAN>

   <SPAN LANG="en-US">`Current Maintainer'</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">any applicable law.</SPAN>

   <SPAN LANG="en-US">`Base Interpreter' </SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">A program or process that is normally needed for running or</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.    </SPAN>

    <SPAN LANG="en-US">A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a</SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">`LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the </SPAN>
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">`LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.</SPAN>



<SPAN LANG="en-US">CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">===========================================</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">directly from the Work.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">be updated versions of the Work.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the Derived Work.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">to a component of the Work. </SPAN>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">for a component of the Work when that component is used with the</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">of this component to the user when used interactively with that</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">Base Interpreter.</SPAN>
     
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">of the changes.</SPAN>
  
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">they do provide such support for the Derived Work.</SPAN>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:</SPAN>

       <SPAN LANG="en-US">1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; </SPAN>
          <SPAN LANG="en-US">if your distribution of a modified component is made by</SPAN>
          <SPAN LANG="en-US">offering access to copy the modified component from a</SPAN>
          <SPAN LANG="en-US">designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy</SPAN>
          <SPAN LANG="en-US">the Work from the same or some similar place meets this</SPAN>
          <SPAN LANG="en-US">condition, even though third parties are not compelled to</SPAN>
          <SPAN LANG="en-US">copy the Work along with the modified component;</SPAN>

       <SPAN LANG="en-US">2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,</SPAN>
          <SPAN LANG="en-US">unmodified copy of the Work.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">regard to the Derived Work.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">applying that process.</SPAN>
     
<SPAN LANG="en-US">10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license</SPAN>
       <SPAN LANG="en-US">provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in</SPAN>
       <SPAN LANG="en-US">Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have</SPAN>
       <SPAN LANG="en-US">to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.</SPAN>
      
    <SPAN LANG="en-US">b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that</SPAN>
       <SPAN LANG="en-US">Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of</SPAN>
       <SPAN LANG="en-US">itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the </SPAN>
       <SPAN LANG="en-US">restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">such works with the Work by any means.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.</SPAN>


<SPAN LANG="en-US">NO WARRANTY</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">===========</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</SPAN>


<SPAN LANG="en-US">MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">=======================</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">or simply that it is `author-maintained'.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">or act upon these error reports.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">significant signs of active maintenance.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the Work through the following steps:</SPAN>

 <SPAN LANG="en-US">1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">an Internet or similar search.</SPAN>

 <SPAN LANG="en-US">2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">is still maintained.</SPAN>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">to update their communication data within one month.</SPAN>
     
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">within the pertinent community your intention to take over</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)</SPAN>

 <SPAN LANG="en-US">3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">immediately upon announcement.</SPAN>
     
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.  </SPAN>
    
 <SPAN LANG="en-US">4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">and after three months your intention is challenged neither by</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.</SPAN>
     
 <SPAN LANG="en-US">5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">reachable once more within three months of a change completed</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided</SPAN>
     <SPAN LANG="en-US">they then update their communication data within one month.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">announce your new status to the same pertinent community as</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">in 2b) above.</SPAN>


<SPAN LANG="en-US">WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">======================================================</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">This section contains important instructions, examples, and</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">this section.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">Choosing This License or Another License</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">----------------------------------------</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">of this license as a model for your own license, but your license</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">your work is distributed under the LPPL.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">license are encouraged to read it.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">-----------------------------------------------------</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">without altering any of its licensed components.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">How to Use This License</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">-----------------------</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">statement that the distribution and/or modification of that</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">component is constrained by the conditions in this license.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">Here is an example of such a notice and statement:</SPAN>

  <SPAN LANG="en-US">%% pig.dtx</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">%% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">%</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% of this license or (at your option) any later version.</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% The latest version of this license is in</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">%   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% version 2005/12/01 or later.</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">%</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% </SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">%</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins</SPAN>
  <SPAN LANG="en-US">% and the derived file pig.sty.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.  </SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">yourself.</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">Derived Works That Are Not Replacements</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">---------------------------------------</SPAN>

<SPAN LANG="en-US">Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.</SPAN>


<SPAN LANG="en-US">Important Recommendations</SPAN>
<SPAN LANG="en-US">-------------------------</SPAN>

 <SPAN LANG="en-US">Defining What Constitutes the Work</SPAN>

   <SPAN LANG="en-US">The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">using a line such as:</SPAN>

    <SPAN LANG="en-US">% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.</SPAN>
   
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise</SPAN>
   <SPAN LANG="en-US">the Work.</SPAN></PRE>
