<pre>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>                       Version 2.1, February 1999<br><br> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br> the version number 2.1.]<br><br>                            Preamble<br><br>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br><br>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br>these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br><br>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br><br>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br>introduced by others.<br><br>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br><br>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br>libraries into non-free programs.<br><br>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br>the library.<br><br>  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it<br>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br>special circumstances.<br><br>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br>a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br>allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br><br>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br>system.<br><br>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br>that program using a modified version of the Library.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br>"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The<br>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br>be combined with the library in order to run.<br><br>                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").<br>Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br><br>  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br><br>  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br>which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the<br>Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br>included without limitation in the term "modification".)<br><br>  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br>and installation of the library.<br><br>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br>and what the program that uses the Library does.<br>  <br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br>Library.<br><br>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br>fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br><br>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br>    its purpose remains meaningful.<br><br>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br>    root function must still compute square roots.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br>it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Library.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br>these notices.<br><br>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br><br>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br>the Library into a program that is not a library.<br><br>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br>medium customarily used for software interchange.<br><br>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br>linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a<br>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br><br>  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br>contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br>library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br><br>  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br><br>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br><br>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br><br>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br>link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br>engineering for debugging such modifications.<br><br>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br>of these things:<br><br>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br>    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br>    to use the modified definitions.)<br><br>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br>    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br><br>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br><br>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br>    specified materials from the same place.<br><br>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br><br>  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br>Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br>the executable.<br><br>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br>distribute.<br><br>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br><br>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br>    Sections above.<br><br>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br><br>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Library or works based on it.<br><br>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br>this License.<br><br>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br>written in the body of this License.<br><br>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br>"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br>the Free Software Foundation.

It is<br>safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br>"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>    &lt;one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br><br>    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br>    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br>    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br>    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br><br>    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Distribution Obligations.<br><br>     3.1. Application of License.<br>     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br>     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br>     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br>     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version<br>     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a<br>     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br>     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br>     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this<br>     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include<br>     an additional document offering the additional rights described in<br>     Section 3.5.<br><br>     3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br>     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br>     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br>     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br>     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br>     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br>     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br>     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br>     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br>     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br>     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br>     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br><br>     3.3. Description of Modifications.<br>     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br>     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br>     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br>     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br>     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br>     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br>     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br>     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br><br>     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br>          (a) Third Party Claims.<br>          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's<br>          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br>          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,<br>          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code<br>          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the<br>          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will<br>          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after<br>          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,<br>          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies<br>          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps<br>          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)<br>          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered<br>          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br><br>          (b) Contributor APIs.<br>          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming<br>          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which<br>          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br>          also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br><br>               (c)    Representations.<br>          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to<br>          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's<br>          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or<br>          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by<br>          this License.<br><br>     3.5. Required Notices.<br>     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br>     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br>     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br>     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely<br>     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)<br>     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in<br>     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br>     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership<br>     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to<br>     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br>     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br>     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br>     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than<br>     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br>     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br>     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br>     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br>     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br><br>     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br>     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br>     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br>     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br>     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br>     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br>     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br>     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the<br>     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br>     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may<br>     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in<br>     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the<br>     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's<br>     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this<br>     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different<br>     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ<br>     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br>     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br>     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br>     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such<br>     terms You offer.<br><br>     3.7. Larger Works.<br>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br>     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br>     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br>     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br><br>     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br>     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br>     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must<br>     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the<br>     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be<br>     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to<br>     understand it.<br><br>5. Application of this License.<br><br>     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br>     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br><br>6. Versions of the License.<br><br>     6.1. New Versions.<br>     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised<br>     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version<br>     will be given a distinguishing version number.<br><br>     6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<br>     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br>     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br>     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one<br>     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to<br>     Covered Code created under this License.<br><br>     6.3. Derivative Works.<br>     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<br>     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br>     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that<br>     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",<br>     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your<br>     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)<br>     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license<br>     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and<br>     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial<br>     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in<br>     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of<br>     this License.)<br><br>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br><br>     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,<br>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br>     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br>     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br>     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br>     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br>     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br><br>8. TERMINATION.<br><br>     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br>     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br>     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br>     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br>     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br>     shall survive.<br><br>     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br>     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br>     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom<br>     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:<br><br>     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br>     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br>     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,<br>     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)<br>     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable<br>     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such<br>     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to<br>     the Contributor Version against such Participant.

U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br><br>     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in<br>     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer<br>     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such<br>     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48<br>     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),<br>     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those<br>     rights set forth herein.<br><br>11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br><br>     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br>     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br>     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if<br>     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,<br>     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United<br>     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be<br>     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern<br>     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,<br>     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including<br>     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and<br>     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on<br>     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br>     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract<br>     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this<br>     License.<br><br>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br><br>     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br>     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br>     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to<br>     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br>     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br>     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br><br>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br><br>     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as<br>     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial<br>     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under<br>     Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified<br>     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br><br>EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.<br><br>   <br><br>---<br><br>COPYRIGHT AND PERMISSION NOTICE<br><br>Copyright (c) 1996 - 2001, Daniel Stenberg, .<br><br>All rights reserved.<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy<br>of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal<br>in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights<br>to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and/or sell copies of the<br>Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,<br>provided that the above copyright notice(s) and this permission notice appear<br>in all copies of the Software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,<br>FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

<pre>Common Public License Version 0.5<br><br>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC<br>LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM<br>CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br>1. DEFINITIONS<br><br>"Contribution" means:<br><br>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation<br>distributed under this Agreement, and<br><br>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:<br><br>i) changes to the Program, and<br><br>ii) additions to the Program;<br><br>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are<br>distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a<br>Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone<br>acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to<br>the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in<br>conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are <br>not derivative works of the Program.<br><br>"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.<br><br>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are<br>necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when<br>combined with the Program.<br><br>"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.<br><br>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,<br>including all Contributors.<br><br>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br><br>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br>Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to<br>reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,<br>distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and <br>such derivative works, in source code and object code form.<br><br>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants<br>Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under <br>Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise <br>transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and <br>object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of <br>the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added <br>by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination <br>to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply <br>to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per <br>se is licensed hereunder.<br><br>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to<br>its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any<br>Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual<br>property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability <br>to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of<br>intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the<br>rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole<br>responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.<br>For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to<br>distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that <br>license before distributing the Program.<br><br>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient <br>copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license <br>set forth in this Agreement.<br><br>3. REQUIREMENTS<br><br>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under <br>its own license agreement, provided that:<br><br>a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br><br>b) its license agreement:<br><br>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and<br>conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title <br>and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability <br>and fitness for a particular purpose;<br><br>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for<br>damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential<br>damages, such as lost profits;<br><br>iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by<br>that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br><br>iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,<br>and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a<br>medium customarily used for software exchange.<br><br>When the Program is made available in source code form:<br><br>a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and<br><br>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.<br><br>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the<br>Program.<br><br>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if<br>any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the<br>originator of the Contribution.<br><br>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br><br>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with<br>respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is<br>intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who<br>includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner<br>which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if<br>a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such<br>Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify<br>every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages<br>and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal<br>actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the<br>extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in<br>connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product<br>offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses<br>relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order<br>to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial<br>Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor <br>to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and <br>any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate <br>in any such claim at its own expense.<br><br>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product<br>offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that<br>Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties<br>related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such<br>Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the<br>Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other<br>Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court<br>requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial<br>Contributor must pay those damages.<br><br>5. NO WARRANTY<br><br>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN<br>"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR<br>IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,<br>NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each<br>Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using <br>and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise <br>of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs <br>of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, <br>programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.<br><br>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br><br>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY<br>CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,<br>SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST<br>PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,<br>STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY <br>WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS<br>GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>7. GENERAL<br><br>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable<br>law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the<br>terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such<br>provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such<br>provision valid and enforceable.<br><br>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to<br>a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a<br>lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient <br>under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In <br>addition, If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including <br>a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself <br>(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes <br>such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section <br>2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br><br>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to<br>comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does<br>not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of<br>such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,<br>Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as<br>reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement<br>and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.<br><br>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in<br>order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be<br>modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to<br>publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.<br>No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.<br>IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve <br>as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the <br>Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including <br>Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement <br>under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is <br>published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its <br>Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections <br>2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual <br>property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether<br>expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not<br>expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br><br>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the<br>intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this<br>Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year<br>after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</pre>

Application of License.<br><br>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are<br>governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation<br>Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be<br>distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version<br>of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a<br>copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You<br>distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code<br>version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this<br>License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include<br>an additional document offering the additional rights described in<br>Section 3.5.<br><br>3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br><br>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be<br>made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License<br>either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted<br>Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an<br>Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic<br>Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)<br>months after the date it initially became available, or at least six<br>(6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification<br>has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for<br>ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the<br>Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br><br>3.3. Description of Modifications.<br><br>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a<br>file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and<br>the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that<br>the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original<br>Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the<br>Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an<br>Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the<br>origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br><br>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.<br><br>(a) Third Party Claims.<br><br>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's<br>intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights<br>granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor<br>must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled<br>"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the party making the claim in<br>sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If<br>Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made<br>available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly<br>modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available<br>thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate<br>mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who<br>received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br><br>(b) Contributor APIs.<br><br>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming<br>interface ("API") and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses<br>which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must<br>also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br><br>(c) Representations.<br><br>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section<br>3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications<br>are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has<br>sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br><br>3.5. Required Notices.<br><br>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source<br>Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source<br>Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a<br>location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely<br>to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)<br>You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in<br>Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation<br>for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership<br>rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to<br>charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability<br>obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You<br>may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial<br>Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than<br>any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is<br>offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial<br>Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the<br>Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,<br>support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br><br>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br><br>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the<br>requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,<br>and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of<br>the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,<br>including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the<br>obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included<br>in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or<br>collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the<br>Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered<br>Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may<br>contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in<br>compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the<br>Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's<br>rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this<br>License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different<br>license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ<br>from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br>Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the<br>Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by<br>the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such<br>terms You offer.<br><br>3.7. Larger Works.<br><br>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code<br>not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger<br>Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the<br>requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br><br>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br><br>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br>License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to<br>statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br>the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br>describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description<br>must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must<br>be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the<br>extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be<br>sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to<br>understand it.<br><br>5. Application of this License.<br><br>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has<br>attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br><br>6. Versions of the License.<br><br>6.1. New Versions.<br><br>Sun Microsystems, Inc. ("Sun") may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a<br>distinguishing version number.<br><br>6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br><br>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the<br>License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that<br>version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms<br>of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one<br>other than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered<br>Code created under this License.<br><br>6.3. Derivative Works.<br><br>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may<br>only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code<br>governed by this License), You must: (a) rename Your license so that<br>the phrases "Sun," "Sun Public License," or "SPL" or any confusingly<br>similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your<br>license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear<br>that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the<br>Sun Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,<br>Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A<br>shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this<br>License.)<br><br>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br><br>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS'' BASIS,<br>WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,<br>WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF<br>DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.<br>THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE<br>IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,<br>YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE<br>COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER<br>OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF<br>ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br><br>8. TERMINATION.<br><br>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure<br>such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All<br>sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall<br>survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their<br>nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License<br>shall survive.<br><br>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement<br>claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer<br>or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom<br>You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:<br><br>(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly<br>infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such<br>Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License<br>shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,<br>unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)<br>agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable<br>royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such<br>Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to<br>the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days<br>of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not<br>mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim<br>is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under<br>Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of<br>the 60 day notice period specified above.<br><br>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's<br>Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then<br>any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)<br>and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,<br>sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that<br>Participant.<br><br>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant<br>alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or<br>indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as<br>by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent<br>infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses<br>granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken<br>into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or<br>license.<br><br>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all<br>end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)<br>which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder<br>prior to termination shall survive termination.<br><br>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br><br>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br>(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL<br>DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,<br>OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR<br>ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY<br>CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,<br>WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br>COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br>INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF<br>LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY<br>RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW<br>PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE<br>EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO<br>THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br><br>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br><br>The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48<br>C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"<br>and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are<br>used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R.<br>12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all<br>U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights<br>set forth herein.<br><br>11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br><br>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br>matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br>unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by<br>California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if<br>any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.<br>With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,<br>or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United<br>States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be<br>subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern<br>District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,<br>California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including<br>without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and<br>expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on<br>Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.<br>Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract<br>shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this<br>License.<br><br>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br><br>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br>responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,<br>out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to<br>work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such<br>responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or<br>shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br><br>13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br><br>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as<br>?Multiple-Licensed?. ?Multiple-Licensed? means that the Initial<br>Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under<br>Your choice of the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the<br>Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br><br>Exhibit A -Sun Public License Notice.<br><br>The contents of this file are subject to the Sun Public License<br>Version 1.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in<br>compliance with the License.

<pre>IBM PUBLIC LICENSE - DAV4J VERSION 2.0 <br><br>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM PUBLIC <br>LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF<br>THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. <br><br>1. DEFINITIONS <br><br>"Contribution" means: <br><br>     a) in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), <br>the Original Program, and <br><br>     b) in the case of each Contributor, <br><br>     i) changes to the Program, and<br><br>     ii) additions to the Program;<br><br>     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are <br>distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a <br>Contributor if it was<br>     added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such <br>Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program <br>which: (i) are<br>     separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program <br>under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the <br>Program.<br><br>"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program. <br><br>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are <br>necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when <br>combined with the Program.<br><br>"Original Program" means the original version of the software accompanying <br>this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code, object code and <br>documentation, if any. <br><br>"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions. <br><br>"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, <br>including all Contributors. <br><br>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS <br><br>     a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants <br>Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to <br>reproduce, prepare<br>     derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and <br>sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative <br>works, in source code<br>     and object code form.<br><br>     b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants <br>Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under <br>Licensed Patents to make,<br>     use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution <br>of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent <br>license shall apply to the<br>     combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the <br>Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution <br>causes such combination to<br>     be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to <br>any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is <br>licensed<br>     hereunder. <br><br>     c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the <br>licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by <br>any Contributor that the<br>     Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property <br>rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to <br>Recipient for claims brought by any<br>     other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or <br>otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted <br>hereunder, each Recipient<br>     hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual <br>property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license <br>is required to allow Recipient to<br>     distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that <br>license before distributing the Program.<br><br>     d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient <br>copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license <br>set forth in this Agreement. <br><br>3. REQUIREMENTS <br><br>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under <br>its own license agreement, provided that: <br><br>     a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and<br><br>     b) its license agreement:<br><br>     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and <br>conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title <br>and non-infringement, and<br>     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a <br>particular purpose; <br><br>     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for <br>damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential <br>damages, such as lost profits; <br><br>     iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are <br>offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and<br><br>     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such <br>Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on <br>or through a medium<br>     customarily used for software exchange. <br><br>When the Program is made available in source code form: <br><br>     a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and <br><br>     b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the <br>Program. <br><br>Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the <br>Program: <br><br>     Copyright } 2000, International Business Machines Corporation and others. <br>All Rights Reserved. <br><br>In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its <br>Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients <br>to identify the originator of<br>the Contribution. <br><br>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION <br><br>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with <br>respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is <br>intended to facilitate the<br>commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a <br>commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create <br>potential liability for<br>other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a <br>commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") <br>hereby agrees to defend and<br>indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any <br>losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, <br>lawsuits and other legal actions<br>brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent <br>caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection <br>with its distribution of the<br>Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do <br>not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged <br>intellectual property infringement. In<br>order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the <br>Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial <br>Contributor to control, and<br>cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related <br>settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any <br>such claim at its own<br>expense. <br><br>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product <br>offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If <br>that Commercial<br>Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to <br>Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial <br>Contributor's responsibility<br>alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend <br>claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and <br>warranties, and if a court<br>requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial <br>Contributor must pay those damages. <br><br>5. NO WARRANTY <br><br>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON <br>AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY<br>KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES <br>OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY<br>OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for <br>determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and <br>assumes all<br>risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including <br>but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with <br>applicable laws, damage to or<br>loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of <br>operations. <br><br>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY <br><br>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY <br>CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,<br>INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING <br>WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON<br>ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT <br>(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE<br>USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED <br>HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br><br>7. GENERAL <br><br>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under <br>applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the <br>remainder of the terms of this Agreement,<br>and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be <br>reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and <br>enforceable. <br><br>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect <br>to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in <br>a lawsuit), then any patent<br>licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement <br>shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If <br>Recipient institutes patent litigation<br>against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) <br>alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with <br>other software or hardware)<br>infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted <br>under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. <br><br>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to <br>comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does <br>not cure such failure in a<br>reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all <br>Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease <br>use and distribution of<br>the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's <br>obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient <br>relating to the Program shall<br>continue and survive. <br><br>IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time <br>to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing <br>version number. The<br>Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the <br>version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new <br>version of the<br>Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program <br>(including its Contributions) under the new version. No one other than IBM has <br>the right to modify this<br>Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, <br>Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any <br>Contributor under this<br>Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All <br>rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. <br><br>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the <br>intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this <br>Agreement will bring a legal<br>action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action <br>arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting <br>litigation. </pre>

For this reason,<br>support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.<br>(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented<br>Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)<br>So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining<br>code.<br><br>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.<br>To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has<br>been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce<br>"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the<br>resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard<br>GIF decoders.<br><br>We are required to state that<br>    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of<br>    CompuServe Incorporated.
