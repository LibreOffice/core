The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the &quot;src&quot;
and &quot;pixman&quot; directories of the cairo source distribution.
There are other components of the cairo source distribution (such as
the &quot;test&quot; and &quot;perf&quot;) that are auxiliary to the
library itself. None of the source code in these directories
contributes to a build of the cairo library itself, (libcairo.so or
cairo.dll or similar).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">These
auxilary components are also free software, but may be under
different license terms than cairo itself. For example, most of the
test cases in the perf and test directories are made available under
a MIT license to simplify any use of this code for reference purposes
in using cairo itself. Other files might be available under the GNU
General Public License (GPL), for example. Again, please see the
opening comment of each file for copyright and licensing information.</P>

is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo
Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free
Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code
if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)
However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program
generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the
foregoing paragraphs do.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
Unix configuration script &quot;configure&quot; was produced with GNU
Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is
freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts
(config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support
script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely
distributable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">It
appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered
by patents owned by IBM, AT&amp;T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic
coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.
 For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from
the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a
marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that
very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware,
there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support
has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
to produce &quot;uncompressed GIFs&quot;.  This technique does not
use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual,
but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
above mentioned file should become obsolete, and the author of the
original file should preferably modify this file instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Modifications
were needed in order to support native UTF-8 engines, but
functionality (hopefully) didn't change in any way, at least not
intentionally. This file is no longer stand-alone; at least for 8-bit
engines you probably want to use loadhyph-foo.tex (which will load
this file) instead.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Modifications
were done by Jonathan Kew, Mojca Miklavec &amp; Arthur Reutenauer
with help &amp; support from: - Karl Berry, who gave us free hands
and all resources - Taco Hoekwater, with useful macros - Hans Hagen,
who did the unicodifisation of patterns already long before and
helped with testing, suggestions and bug reports - Norbert Preining,
who tested &amp; integrated patterns into TeX Live</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">However,
the &quot;copyright/copyleft&quot; owner of patterns remains the
original author.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
copyright statement of this file is thus:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Do
with this file whatever needs to be done in future for the sake of &quot;a
better world&quot; as long as you respect the copyright of original
file. If you're the original author of patterns or taking over a new
revolution, please remove all of the TUG comments &amp; credits that
we added here - you are the Queen / the King, we are only the
servants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
you want to change this file, rather than uploading directly to CTAN,
we would be grateful if you could send it to us
(<A HREF="http://tug.org/tex-hyphen">http://tug.org/tex-hyphen</A>)
or ask for credentials for SVN repository and commit it yourself; we
will then upload the whole &quot;package&quot; to CTAN.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Before
a new &quot;pattern-revolution&quot; starts, please try to follow
some guidelines if possible:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">-
\lccode is *forbidden*, and I really mean it - all the patterns
should be in UTF-8 - the only &quot;allowed&quot; TeX commands in
this file are: \patterns, \hyphenation, and if you really cannot do
without, also \input and \message - in particular, please no \catcode
or \lccode changes, they belong to loadhyph-foo.tex, and no
\lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin, they have no influence here and
belong elsewhere - \begingroup and/or \endinput is not needed - feel
free to do whatever you want inside comments</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">We
know that TeX is extremely powerful, but give a stupid parser at
least a chance to read your patterns.</P>

<PRE CLASS="western">Wordlist en_CA spelling and morphological dictionary for OpenOffice.org
Version 2008-12-18

Based on Wordlist Hunspell dictionaries version 2008-12-05
and Wordlist POS and AGID data created by Kevin Atkinson
and released on <A HREF="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/">http://wordlist.sourceforge.net</A>.

Other fixes:

OOo Issue 48060 - add numbers with affixes by COMPOUNDRULE (1st, 111th, 1990s etc.)
New REP items (better suggestions for accented words and a few mistakes)
OOo Issue 63541 - remove *dessicated, *dessication

Original license:

2008-12-05 Release

README file for en_US and en_CA Hunspell dictionaries

These dictionaries are created using the speller/make-hunspell-dict
dictionary in SCOWL, SVN revision 74.

The NOSUGGEST flag was added to certain taboo words.  While I made an
honest attempt to flag the strongest taboo words with the NOSUGGEST
flag, I MAKE NO GUARANTEE THAT I FLAGGED EVERY POSSIBLE TABOO WORD.
The list was originally derived from Németh László, however I removed
some words which, while being considered taboo by some dictionaries,
are not really considered swear words in today's society.

You can find SCOWL and friend at <A HREF="http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/">http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/</A>.
Bug reports should go to the Issue Tracker found on the previously
mentioned web site.  General discussion should go to the
wordlist-devel at sourceforge net mailing list.

COPYRIGHT, SOURCES, and CREDITS:

The en_US and en_CA dictionaries come directly from SCOWL (up to level
60) and is thus under the same copyright of SCOWL.  The affix file is
a heavily modified version of the original english.aff file which was
released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell and as such is covered by
his BSD license.  Part of SCOWL is also based on Ispell thus the
Ispell copyright is included with the SCOWL copyright.

The collective work is Copyright 2000-2007 by Kevin Atkinson as well
as any of the copyrights mentioned below:

  Copyright 2000-2007 by Kevin Atkinson

  Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute and sell these word
  lists, the associated scripts, the output created from the scripts,
  and its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee,
  provided that the above copyright notice appears in all copies and
  that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
  supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson makes no representations
  about the suitability of this array for any purpose. It is provided
  &quot;as is&quot; without express or implied warranty.

Alan Beale &lt;biljir@pobox.com&gt; also deserves special credit as he has,
in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major
contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of
feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the
Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.

The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to
the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most
common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and
frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's &quot;UK English Wordlist
with Frequency Classification&quot;.

The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:

    The Moby lexicon project is complete and has
    been place into the public domain. Use, sell,
    rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.

    Placing this material on internal or public servers is
    also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any
    export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.

    You can verify the public domain status by contacting

The &quot;UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification&quot; is also in the
Public Domain:

  Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100
  From: Brian Kelk &lt;Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk&gt;

  &gt; I was wondering what the copyright status of your &quot;UK English
  &gt; Wordlist With Frequency Classification&quot; word list as it seems to
  &gt; be lacking any copyright notice.

  There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
  &quot;copyright&quot; was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
  source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
  PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
  domain.

  Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100

  &gt; So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?

  That is the intention.

The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.

The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at
least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All
words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via
my inflection database.

The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.

Inflections database, is under the following copyright:

The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
don't think can be copyrighted.

The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the
&quot;Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists&quot; which is derived from &quot;The Jargon

added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of
the 12Dics package which is the public domain

The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the
ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the &quot;UK Advanced Cryptics

The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper &lt;thegrendel@theriver.com&gt;,
is in the Public Domain:

  The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released
  into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in
  any manner they see fit. No fee or registration is required for its
  use nor are &quot;contributions&quot; solicited (if you feel you absolutely
  must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of
  the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your
  favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble
  community, as an alternate to &quot;official&quot; word lists. Game designers
  may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please
  mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note
  that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,
  you may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*
  legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
  WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict your
  rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only fair.

version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as
you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to
it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
of that published version or of any later version published by the
Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

Preamble</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">This
license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can
use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
below.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">When
we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can
get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use
pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you
can do these things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
these rights. These restrictions translate to certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or
if you modify it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">For
example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">We
protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is
no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by
someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they
have is not the original version, so that the original author's
reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced
by others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Finally,
software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive
license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent
license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with
the full freedom of use specified in this license.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Most
GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General
Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this
license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">When
a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">We
call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary
General Public License. It also provides other free software
developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public
License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">For
example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage
the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a
de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed
to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does
the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there
is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only,
so we use the Lesser General Public License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">In
other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Although
the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that
program using a modified version of the Library.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library,
whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION
AND MODIFICATION</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>0.</STRONG>
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms
of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this
License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">A
&quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
executables.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
&quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or
work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based
on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or
a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">&quot;Source
code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Activities
other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a
program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>1.</STRONG>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>2.</STRONG>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>a)</STRONG> The modified work must itself be a software
	library.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>b)</STRONG> You must cause the files modified to carry
	prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
	any change.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>c)</STRONG> You must cause the whole of the work to be
	licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
	License.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>d)</STRONG> If a facility in the modified Library refers to
	a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application
	program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed
	when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
	to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
	function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
	whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
	purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
	application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
	application-supplied function or table used by this function must be
	optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
	function must still compute square roots.)</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">These
requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the
same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the
Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Thus,
it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">In
addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>3.</STRONG>
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version
2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of
the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other
change in these notices.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Once
this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">This
option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
Library into a program that is not a library.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>4.</STRONG>
You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>5.</STRONG>
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked
with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">However,
linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses
the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this
License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">When
a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header
file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be
a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions
(ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
will still fall under Section 6.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Otherwise,
if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any
executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>6.</STRONG>
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the work with the complete
	corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including
	whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed
	under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable
	linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work
	that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so
	that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
	modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is
	understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions
	files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the
	application to use the modified definitions.)</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>b)</STRONG> Use a suitable shared library mechanism for
	linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses
	at run time a copy of the library already present on the user's
	computer system, rather than copying library functions into the
	executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of
	the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
	version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
	made with.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>c)</STRONG> Accompany the work with a written offer, valid
	for at least three years, to give the same user the materials
	specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the
	cost of performing this distribution.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>d)</STRONG> If distribution of the work is made by offering
	access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to
	copy the above specified materials from the same place.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>e)</STRONG> Verify that the user has already received a copy
	of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">For
an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the
Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">It
may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the
operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them
and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>7.</STRONG>
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a
combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work
based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany the combined library with a copy of

	library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the
	Sections above.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	<STRONG>b)</STRONG> Give prominent notice with the combined library
	of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
	explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the
	same work.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>8.</STRONG>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>9.</STRONG>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>10.</STRONG>
Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>11.</STRONG>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this

such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.</P>

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</P>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions

versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Each
version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not
specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.</P>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.</P>

Preamble</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">This
license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for
your libraries, too.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">When
we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">For
example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Our
method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the
library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Also,
for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library.
If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original version,
so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
original authors' reputations.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Finally,
any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software
will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming
the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made
it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or
not licensed at all.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Most
GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.
This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to
certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from
the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that
anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding
to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library,
without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the
library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application
program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable
is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the
ordinary General Public License treats it as such.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Because
of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public
License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing,
because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that
weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">However,
unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of
those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries
themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit
developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to
achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved
it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The
hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the
library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library,
while the latter only works together with the library.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Note
that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

<H2 CLASS="western">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION
AND MODIFICATION</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>0.</STRONG>
This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General
Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee
is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">A
&quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
executables.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
&quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or
work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based
on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work
under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or
a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.)
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">&quot;Source
code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Activities
other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a
program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>1.</STRONG>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>2.</STRONG>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">

	any change.
	</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">

	<STRONG>d)</STRONG> If a facility in the modified Library refers to
	a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application
	program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed
	when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort
	to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such
	function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
	whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
	</P>
	<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
	purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
	application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
	application-supplied function or table used by this function must be
	optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
	function must still compute square roots.)</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">These
requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when
you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the
same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the
Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Thus,
it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">In
addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>3.</STRONG>
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version
2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of
the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can
specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other
change in these notices.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Once
this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">This
option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
Library into a program that is not a library.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>4.</STRONG>
You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with
the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
source along with the object code.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>5.</STRONG>
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked
with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">However,
linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses
the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this
License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">When
a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header
file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be
a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions
(ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
(Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
will still fall under Section 6.)
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Otherwise,
if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any
executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether
or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>6.</STRONG>
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a
&quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these things:

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the

otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>10.</STRONG>
Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the
Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Library.

implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that

willing to distribute software through any other system and a

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Everyone
is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="preamble1"></A>Preamble</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to
take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software
Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our
software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its
authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">When
we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these
rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">For
example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms
that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can
get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know
their rights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Developers
that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">For
the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Some
devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can
do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.
If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready
to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the
GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Finally,
every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software
on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid
the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make
it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="terms1"></A>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</H2>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section02"></A>0. Definitions.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">“This
License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">“Copyright”
also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">“The
Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
“modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified
version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier
work.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">A
“covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work
based on the Program.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
“propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
“convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">An
interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices”
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section13"></A>1. Source Code.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
“source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source
form of a work.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">A
“Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an
official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the
case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language,
one that is widely used among developers working in that language.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
“System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential
component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
to run it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
“Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts
to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available
free programs which are used unmodified in performing those
activities but which are not part of the work. For example,
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated
with source files for the work, and the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section22"></A>2. Basic Permissions.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">All
rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in
force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of
having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply
with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which
you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the
covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under
your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making
any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
with you.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Conveying
under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section32"></A>3. Protecting Users'
Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">No
covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">When
you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,
against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section42"></A>4. Conveying Verbatim
Copies.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section52"></A>5. Conveying Modified
Source Versions.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
	it, and giving a relevant date.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
	under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
	requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact
	all notices”.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
	to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
	therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
	terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
	how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
	the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
	permission if you have separately received it.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
	Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
	interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
	need not make them do so.</P>
</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">A
compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are
not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's
users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered
work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the
other parts of the aggregate.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section62"></A>6. Conveying Non-Source
Forms.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
	(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
	offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
	offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to
	give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
	Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
	covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
	used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
	reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,

	at no charge.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the

	received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
	subsection 6b.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
	d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place

“User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which
means any tangible personal property which is normally used for
personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or
sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a
product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in
favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that
class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or
of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or
is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product
regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
significant mode of use of the product.</P>

Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and
execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified
object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.</P>

you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).</P>

itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">“Additional
permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be
treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</P>

you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
(Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal
in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which
you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</P>

</UL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">All
other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as
you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it
is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must
place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional
terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find
the applicable terms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Additional
terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above
requirements apply either way.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section81"></A>8. Termination.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">However,
if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless
and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify
you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after
the cessation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Moreover,
your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received
notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Termination
of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this
License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section91"></A>9. Acceptance Not
Required for Having Copies.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section101"></A>10. Automatic Licensing
of Downstream Recipients.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Each
time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate
that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">An
“entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights
granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section112"></A>11. Patents.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">A
“contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor
version”.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">A
contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor
version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to
grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements
of this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Each
contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">In
the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not
to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license
to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to
enforce a patent against the party.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and
the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the
patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying”
means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license,
your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use
of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more
identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe
are valid.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If,
pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent
license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the
covered work and works based on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">A
patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make
payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of
conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of
the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the
covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or
(b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into
that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28
March 2007.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Nothing
in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise
be available to you under applicable patent law.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section121"></A>12. No Surrender of
Others' Freedom.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further
conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you
could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain
entirely from conveying the Program.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section131"></A>13. Use with the GNU
Affero General Public License.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Notwithstanding
any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or
combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the
GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to
convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to
apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special
requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13,
concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section14"></A>14. Revised Versions of
this License.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
detail to address new problems or concerns.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Each
version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option
of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Later
license versions may give you additional or different permissions.
However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or
copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later
version.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="section15"></A>15. Disclaimer of
Warranty.</H3>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">THERE

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to

if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">For
example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">We
protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Also,
for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Finally,
any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">The
precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__12247_1300998327"></A><A NAME="terms"></A>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section01"></A>
<STRONG>0.</STRONG> This License applies to any program or other work
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may
be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
&quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a
&quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term
&quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Activities
other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the
Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered
only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether
that is true depends on what the Program does.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section11"></A>
<STRONG>1.</STRONG> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of
the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this
License along with the Program.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">You
may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section21"></A>
<STRONG>2.</STRONG> You may modify your copy or copies of the Program
or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</P>
<DL>
	<DD CLASS="western"><STRONG>a)</STRONG> You must cause the modified
	files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
	and the date of any change.</DD><DD CLASS="western">
	<STRONG>b)</STRONG> You must cause any work that you distribute or
	publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
	Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
	to all third parties under the terms of this License.</DD><DD CLASS="western">
	<STRONG>c)</STRONG> If the modified program normally reads commands
	interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for
	such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
	an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
	notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
	warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
	conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
	(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
	normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
	is not required to print an announcement.)</DD></DL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Thus,
it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">In
addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section31"></A>
<STRONG>3.</STRONG> You may copy and distribute the Program (or a
work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
one of the following:</P>
<DL>
	<DD CLASS="western"><STRONG>a)</STRONG> Accompany it with the
	complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
	distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
	customarily used for software interchange; or,</DD><DD CLASS="western">
	<STRONG>b)</STRONG> Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at
	least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
	than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a
	complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to
	be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
	customarily used for software interchange; or,</DD><DD CLASS="western">
	<STRONG>c)</STRONG> Accompany it with the information you received
	as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
	alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only
	if you received the program in object code or executable form with
	such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</DD></DL>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of
the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy
the source along with the object code.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section41"></A>
<STRONG>4.</STRONG> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or
distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section51"></A>
<STRONG>5.</STRONG> You are not required to accept this License,
since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative
works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section61"></A>
<STRONG>6.</STRONG> Each time you redistribute the Program (or any
work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the
Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any
further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section7"></A>
<STRONG>7.</STRONG> If, as a consequence of a court judgment or
allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions
of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program
at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended
to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">It
is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">This
section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section8"></A>
<STRONG>8.</STRONG> If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case,
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
this License.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section9"></A>
<STRONG>9.</STRONG> The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">Each
version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section10"></A>
<STRONG>10.</STRONG> If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program
into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different,
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
sharing and reuse of software generally.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><A NAME="section111"></A>
<STRONG>NO WARRANTY</STRONG></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in"><STRONG>11.</STRONG>
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT
WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER

<STRONG>12.</STRONG> IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">If
you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make
it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under
these terms.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-top: 0.12in; margin-bottom: 0.12in">To
do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice
is found.</P>

LPPL Version 1.3c  2008-05-04

Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project
    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.


PREAMBLE
========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under
which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.

You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly
suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but
it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is
unrelated to TeX.

The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',
below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors
who are considering distributing their works under this license.

This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
that work may be distributed.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work
that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'
and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.


DEFINITIONS
===========

In this license document the following terms are used:

   `Work'
    Any work being distributed under this License.

   `Derived Work'
    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.

   `Modification'
    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language.

   `Modify'
    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
    applicable law.

   `Distribution'
    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in
    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)
    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file
    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).

   `Compiled Work'
    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it
    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may
    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation
    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.

   `Current Maintainer'
    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is
    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under
    any applicable law.

   `Base Interpreter'
    A program or process that is normally needed for running or
    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.

    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these
    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each
    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the
    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a
    `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the
    `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.



CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===========================================

1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work
are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In
particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.

2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.

3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
directly from the Work.

4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may
also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including
Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works
distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to
be updated versions of the Work.

5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify
your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,
and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on
the Derived Work.

6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states
in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only
the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption
to a component of the Work.

  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement
     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the
     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that
     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work
     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version
     of this component to the user when used interactively with that
     Base Interpreter.

  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a
     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part
     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log
     of the changes.

  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version
     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the
     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that
     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.

  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:

       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work;
          if your distribution of a modified component is made by
          offering access to copy the modified component from a
          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to
          copy the Work along with the modified component;

       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
          unmodified copy of the Work.

7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as
the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled
Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with
regard to the Derived Work.

8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as
it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.

9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is
then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or
nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of
applying that process.

10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in
       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have
       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.

    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of
       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the
       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.

11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
such works with the Work by any means.

12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.


NO WARRANTY
===========

There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in
writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the
Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of
the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited
to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by
anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other
programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.


MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
=======================

The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in
the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder
or simply that it is `author-maintained'.

The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer
who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error
reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail
address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge
or act upon these error reports.

The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
significant signs of active maintenance.

You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.

If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of
the Work through the following steps:

 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and
     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of
     an Internet or similar search.

 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work
     is still maintained.

  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer
     to update their communication data within one month.

  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce
     within the pertinent community your intention to take over
     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be
     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)

 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect
     immediately upon announcement.

  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright
     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,
     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.

 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by
     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other
     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as
     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.

 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
     reachable once more within three months of a change completed
     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must
     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided
     they then update their communication data within one month.

A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact
that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.

If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also
announce your new status to the same pertinent community as
in 2b) above.


WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
======================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in
this section.

Choosing This License or Another License
----------------------------------------

If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*
conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then
do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text
of this license as a model for your own license, but your license
should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
your work is distributed under the LPPL.

The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains
the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any
license are encouraged to read it.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own
personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such
modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by
accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or
it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions
of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,
cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your
best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public
one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work
without altering any of its licensed components.

How to Use This License
-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work
was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a
statement that the distribution and/or modification of that
component is constrained by the conditions in this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

  %% pig.dtx
  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
  %
  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
  % The latest version of this license is in
  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
  % version 2005/12/01 or later.
  %
  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
  %
  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
  %
  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
  % and the derived file pig.sty.

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions
given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring
to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being
generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and
`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.

If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your
Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.
However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance
section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to
the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
yourself.

Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
---------------------------------------

Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and
stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves
with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a
(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If
this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a
completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.


Important Recommendations
-------------------------

 Defining What Constitutes the Work

   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the
   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a
   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.
   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the
   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by
   using a line such as:

    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be
   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise
   the Work.</PRE><H1 CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always">
