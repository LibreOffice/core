\pard\qj\b\fs20 HOME USE.\b0  Collabora grants primary users of Subscription Services Entitlements and their immediate family members a License to reproduce and use copies of the Software for Home Use as detailed below unless otherwise prohibited by any applicable laws, policies or regulations.

\fs20\par
\b LICENSE COMPLIANCE AUDIT\b0 . Collabora may, upon fifteen (15) days\rquote  advance notice and at its expense, conduct an annual audit if You are an Organisation, during your normal business hours, of Your use of the Software to verify compliance with this Agreement and in particular Your commitment under the License herein to purchase an equivalent number units of Subscription Services Entitlements. You agree to keep records sufficient to certify your compliance with this Agreement. Upon Collabora\rquote s or its authorized representative\rquote s reasonable written commitment(s) to safeguard your confidential information, you shall fully cooperate with such audit and provide any necessary assistance and access to records and computers.

OPEN SOURCE LICENCES/REQUIREMENTS.\b0  Many of the individual components included in the Software are licensed primarily pursuant to Mozilla Public License v2.0 open source licence, in addition to other open source licences identified in the documentation or located in the source code or binary code for the component.

\fs20 Whilst this Agreement in no way limits Your rights under such licences, nor is it intended to supersede or conflict with the licence terms or obligations for use of any individual open source component, the Mozilla Public License v2.0 has been utilised to license the majority of the components comprising the Software because it allows the imposition (as is set out in its paragraph 3.2(b)) of the conditions of this Agreement on the free distribution of Software in its Executable Form.\fs24\par
\fs20 For the avoidance of doubt, Collabora branding, theme data and Collabora Marks are not made available under an Open Source license.\fs24\par
\b\fs20\par

\fs20 1) By purchasing maintenance services You are entitled to install and use all upgrades and updates made commercially available by Collabora during the period covered by the maintenance services subscription, up to the number of installations for which You have purchase maintenance services. \fs24\par
\fs20\par
2) Any \ldblquote update\rdblquote  means a fix or compilation of fixes released by Collabora to correct operational errors (a defect that prevents it from operating substantially as intended, where such intent shall be deduced based on a competent inspection of the source code and documentation) in the Software. An \ldblquote upgrade\rdblquote  means any new version of the Software which bears the same product name, including version changes evidenced by a number immediately after the name of the Software. \fs24\par
\fs20\par
3) If a question arises as to whether a release by Collabora is an upgrade or an update or a new Software product, Collabora\rquote s opinion will prevail provided that Collabora treats the product offering the same for its end users generally.\fs24\par
\fs20\par
4) If Collabora commercially releases any upgrade or updates, it will make such upgrades or updates available to You within a reasonable period of time after they become commercially available, although Collabora cannot guarantee any specific turnaround times and/or regular release intervals. \fs24\par

\fs20\par
\b SUPPORT SERVICES\b0\fs24\par

\f0\fs20 - Your limit on the number of support cases that You can report for each such allocated case severity level (although for the avoidance of doubt, any unused limit cannot be refunded and expires at the end of the Subscription Services Entitlement period unless otherwise agreed). \f1\fs22\par
\f0\fs20 The specific terms are subject to change from time to time and accordingly are set out at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://www.CollaboraOffice.com/ }}{\fldrslt{http://www.CollaboraOffice.com/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs20 , unless separately agreed with You such as in a purchase order. You are urged to check these terms again now before proceeding with any purchase of Subscription Services Entitlements. \f1\fs22\par
\f0\fs20 Alternatively, Collabora also entitle You to purchase the support services entitlement from a reseller or other intermediary rather than from Collabora directly. If You have purchased the services entitlement from such a party please check with them if any support service entitlement terms have been separately negotiated between them and Collabora, as any such terms are deemed to be incorporated into this Agreement and shall take precedence over any conflicting terms set out at {{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK http://www.CollaboraOffice.com/ }}{\fldrslt{http://www.CollaboraOffice.com/\ul0\cf0}}}}\f0\fs20  or on a purchase order.\f1\fs22\par
