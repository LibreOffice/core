Cairo

   The following software may be included in this product: Cairo. Use of
   any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below:

   Cairo is free software.

   Every source file in the implementation[*] of cairo is available to be
   redistributed and/or modified under the terms of either the GNU Lesser
   General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public License
   (MPL) version 1.1. Some files are available under more liberal terms,
   but we believe that in all cases, each file may be used under either
   the LGPL or the MPL.

   See the following files in this directory for the precise terms and
   conditions of either license:

   See LGPL Version 2.1 below

   See MPL Version 1.1 below

   Please see each file in the implementation for copyright and licensing
   information, (in the opening comment of each file).

   [*] The implementation of cairo is contained entirely within the "src"
   and "pixman" directories of the cairo source distribution. There are
   other components of the cairo source distribution (such as the "test"
   and "perf") that are auxiliary to the library itself. None of the
   source code in these directories contributes to a build of the cairo
   library itself, (libcairo.so or cairo.dll or similar).

   These auxiliary components are also free software, but may be under
   different license terms than cairo itself. For example, most of the
   test cases in the perf and test directories are made available under a
   MIT license to simplify any use of this code for reference purposes in
   using cairo itself. Other files might be available under the GNU
   General Public License (GPL), for example. Again, please see the
   opening comment of each file for copyright and licensing information.

   Freetype Library

   The following software may be included in this product: Freetype. Use
   of any of this software is governed by the terms of the license below:

  0. Definitions

   Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and
   `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by
   the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the
   `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.

   `You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where
   `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code
   as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'. This program
   is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine'.

   This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType
   Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless
   otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as
   distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a
   particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to
   verify this.

   The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert
   Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified
   below.

  1. No Warranty

   THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL
   ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
   CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

  2. Redistribution

   This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and
   irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile,
   display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense
   the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and
   derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to
   exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the
   following conditions:
     * Redistribution of source code must retain this license file
       ('FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the
       original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying
       documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original
       files must be preserved in all copies of source files.
     * Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states
       that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType
       Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to
       put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though
       this isn't mandatory.

   These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the
   FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work,
   you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us.

  3. Advertising

   Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the
   name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes
   without specific prior written permission.

   We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the
   following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or
   advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType
   library', or `FreeType Distribution'.

   As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it.
   However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this
   license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the
   right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using,
   distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you
   understand and accept all the terms of this license.

  4. Contacts

   There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
     * freetype@freetype.org

   Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future
   and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are
   looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything
   to help you in the documentation.
     * devel@freetype.org

   Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific
   licenses, porting, etc.

IJG JPEG Library

   The following software may be included in this product: IJG JPEG
   Library. Use of any of this software is governed by the terms of the
   license below:

   In plain English:
    1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any
       bugs, please let us know!)
    2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to
       pay us.
    3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in
       a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation
       that you've used the IJG code.

   In legalese:

   The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or
   implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy,
   merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is
   provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its
   quality and accuracy.

   This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights
   Reserved except as specified below.

   Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
   software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to
   these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software
   is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this
   copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions,
   deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated
   in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is
   distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this
   software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
   (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user
   accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the
   authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

   These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG
   code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you
   ought to acknowledge us.

   Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or
   company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or
   products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the
   Independent JPEG Group's software".

   We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the
   basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability
   claims are assumed by the product vendor.

   ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter
   Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises
   of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and
   conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free
   Software Foundation; principally, that you must include source code if
   you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)
   However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program
   generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the
   foregoing paragraphs do.

   The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU
   Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely
   distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess,
   config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh,
   is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

   It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is
   covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic
   coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.
   For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from
   the free JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a
   marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that
   very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware,
   there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.

   The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF
   files. To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading
   support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been
   simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use
   the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but
   are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

   We are required to state that

   "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
   CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
   CompuServe Incorporated."

   rendering LIBERATION typefaces in sans-serif, serif, and monospaced
   character styles. You are licensed to use, modify, copy, and distribute
   the Software pursuant to the GNU General Public License v.2 with the
   following exceptions:

   (a) As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this
   font, and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the
   document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to
   be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
   however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered
   by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may
   extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not
   obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
   statement from your version.

   (b) As a further exception, any distribution of the object code of the
   Software in a physical product must provide you the right to access and
   modify the source code for the Software and to reinstall that modified
   version of the Software in object code form on the same physical
   product on which you received it.

   2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Software and each of its
   components, including the source code, documentation, appearance,
   structure and organization are owned by Red Hat and others and are
   protected under copyright and other laws. Title to the Software and any
   component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion shall remain
   with the aforementioned, subject to the applicable license. The
   "LIBERATION" trademark is a trademark of Red Hat, Inc. in the U.S. and
   other countries. This agreement does not permit Client to distribute
   modified versions of the Software using Red Hat's trademarks. If Client
   makes a redistribution of a modified version of the Software, then
   Client must modify the files names to remove any reference to the Red
   Hat trademarks and must not use the Red Hat trademarks in any way to
   reference or promote the modified Software.

   3. Limited Warranty. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable
   law, the Software is provided and licensed "as is" without warranty of
   any kind, expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of
   merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose.
   Red Hat does not warrant that the functions contained in the Software
   will meet Client's requirements or that the operation of the Software
   will be entirely error free or appear precisely as described in the
   accompanying documentation.

   4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent
   permitted by applicable law, Red Hat or any Red Hat authorized dealer
   will not be liable to Client for any incidental or consequential
   damages, including lost profits or lost savings arising out of the use
   or inability to use the Software, even if Red Hat or such dealer has
   been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   5. General. If any provision of this agreement is held to be
   unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the
   remaining provisions. This agreement shall be governed by the laws of
   the State of North Carolina and of the United States, without regard to
   any conflict of laws provisions, except that the United Nations
   Convention on the International Sale of Goods shall not apply.

Linux Libertine G and Linux Biolinum G

   This Font Software is Copyright (c) 2003-2006, Philipp H. Poll
   (http://linuxlibertine.sf.net/).
   All Rights Reserved.
   "Linux Libertine" is a Reserved Font Name for this Font Software.

   Graphite extension of the original Linux Libertine font was made by
   Laszlo Nemeth under the same license.
   Our fonts are free in the sense of the GPL. In short: Changing the font
   is allowed as long as the derivative work is published under the same
   license again. Pedantics keep claiming that the embedded use of
   GPL-fonts in i.e. PDFs requires the free publication of the PDF as
   well. This is why our GPL contains the so called "font exception".

   See GPL version 2 below

   As a special exception, if you create a document which uses this font,
   and embed this font or unaltered portions of this font into the
   document, this font does not by itself cause the resulting document to
   be covered by the GNU General Public License. This exception does not
   however invalidate any other reasons why the document might be covered
   by the GNU General Public License. If you modify this font, you may
   extend this exception to your version of the font, but you are not
   obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
   statement from your version.

   Additionally our fonts are licensed under the Open Fonts License (see
   below).

   This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version
   1.0. No modification of the license is permitted, only verbatim copy is
   allowed. This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ

  SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.0 - 22 November 2005

   PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate
   worldwide development of cooperative font projects, to support the font
   creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
   an open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in
   partnership with others.

   The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
   redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
   fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
   redistributed and sold with any software provided that the font names
   of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives, however,
   cannot be released under any other type of license.

   DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to any and all of the following: -
   font files - data files - source code - build scripts - documentation

   "Reserved Font Name" refers to the Font Software name as seen by users
   and any other names as specified after the copyright statement.

   "Standard Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
   as distributed by the Copyright Holder.

   "Modified Version" refers to any derivative font software made by
   adding to, deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of
   the components of the Standard Version, by changing formats or by
   porting the Font Software to a new environment.

   "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer
   or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

   PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge,

   included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in
   the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary
   files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
   Name(s), in part or in whole, unless explicit written permission is
   granted by the Copyright Holder. This restriction applies to all
   references stored in the Font Software, such as the font menu name and
   other font description fields, which are used to differentiate the font
   from others.

   4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder or the Author(s) of the Font
   Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
   Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
   Copyright Holder and the Author(s) or with their explicit written

   These patterns were manually converted from TeX hyphenation patterns
   using the guide at
   http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/SL/Using_Te
   X_hyphenation_patterns_in_OpenOffice.org

   Original version:
   http://tug.org/svn/texhyphen/trunk/hyph-utf8/tex/generic/hyph-utf8
   /patterns/txt/hyph-hr.pat.txt?revision=416

   License: OpenOffice.org adaption of this file is licensed under the GNU
   LGPL license.

   See LGPL Version 2.1 below

   Original license text: This file is part of hyph-utf8 package and
   resulted from semi-manual conversions of hyphenation patterns into
   UTF-8 in June 2008.

   Source: hrhyph.tex (1996-04-10) Author: Marinović Igor <migor at
   student.math.hr>

   The above mentioned file should become obsolete, and the author of the
   original file should preferably modify this file instead.

   Modifications were needed in order to support native UTF-8 engines, but
   functionality (hopefully) didn't change in any way, at least not
   intentionally. This file is no longer stand-alone; at least for 8-bit
   engines you probably want to use loadhyph-foo.tex (which will load this
   file) instead.

   Modifications were done by Jonathan Kew, Mojca Miklavec & Arthur
   Reutenauer with help & support from: - Karl Berry, who gave us free
   hands and all resources - Taco Hoekwater, with useful macros - Hans
   Hagen, who did the unicodifisation of patterns already long before and
   helped with testing, suggestions and bug reports - Norbert Preining,
   who tested & integrated patterns into TeX Live

   However, the "copyright/copyleft" owner of patterns remains the
   original author.

   The copyright statement of this file is thus:

   Do with this file whatever needs to be done in future for the sake of
   "a better world" as long as you respect the copyright of original file.
   If you're the original author of patterns or taking over a new
   revolution, please remove all of the TUG comments & credits that we
   added here - you are the Queen / the King, we are only the servants.

   If you want to change this file, rather than uploading directly to
   CTAN, we would be grateful if you could send it to us
   (http://tug.org/tex-hyphen) or ask for credentials for SVN
   repository and commit it yourself; we will then upload the whole
   "package" to CTAN.

   Before a new "pattern-revolution" starts, please try to follow some
   guidelines if possible:

   - \lccode is *forbidden*, and I really mean it - all the patterns
   should be in UTF-8 - the only "allowed" TeX commands in this file are:
   \patterns, \hyphenation, and if you really cannot do without, also
   \input and \message - in particular, please no \catcode or \lccode
   changes, they belong to loadhyph-foo.tex, and no \lefthyphenmin and
   \righthyphenmin, they have no influence here and belong elsewhere -
   \begingroup and/or \endinput is not needed - feel free to do whatever
   you want inside comments

   We know that TeX is extremely powerful, but give a stupid parser at
   least a chance to read your patterns.

README file for en_US and en_CA Hunspell dictionaries

These dictionaries are created using the speller/make-hunspell-dict
dictionary in SCOWL, SVN revision 74.

The NOSUGGEST flag was added to certain taboo words.  While I made an
honest attempt to flag the strongest taboo words with the NOSUGGEST
flag, I MAKE NO GUARANTEE THAT I FLAGGED EVERY POSSIBLE TABOO WORD.
The list was originally derived from Németh László, however I removed
some words which, while being considered taboo by some dictionaries,
are not really considered swear words in today's society.

You can find SCOWL and friend at http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/.
Bug reports should go to the Issue Tracker found on the previously
mentioned web site.  General discussion should go to the
wordlist-devel at sourceforge net mailing list.

COPYRIGHT, SOURCES, and CREDITS:

The en_US and en_CA dictionaries come directly from SCOWL (up to level
60) and is thus under the same copyright of SCOWL.  The affix file is
a heavily modified version of the original english.aff file which was
released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell and as such is covered by
his BSD license.  Part of SCOWL is also based on Ispell thus the
Ispell copyright is included with the SCOWL copyright.

The collective work is Copyright 2000-2007 by Kevin Atkinson as well
as any of the copyrights mentioned below:

  Copyright 2000-2007 by Kevin Atkinson

  Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute and sell these word
  lists, the associated scripts, the output created from the scripts,
  and its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee,
  provided that the above copyright notice appears in all copies and
  that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
  supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson makes no representations
  about the suitability of this array for any purpose. It is provided
  "as is" without express or implied warranty.

Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,
in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major
contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of
feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the
Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.

The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to
the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most
common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and
frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist
with Frequency Classification".

The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:

    The Moby lexicon project is complete and has
    been place into the public domain. Use, sell,
    rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.

    Placing this material on internal or public servers is
    also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any
    export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.

The "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" is also in the
Public Domain:

  Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100
  From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk>

  > I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English
  > Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to
  > be lacking any copyright notice.

  There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
  "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
  source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
  PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
  domain.

  Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100

  > So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?

  That is the intention.

The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.

The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at
least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All
words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via
my inflection database.

The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.

Inflections database, is under the following copyright:

The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0
of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the
public domain.

The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words appearing
in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts
package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12
dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The
top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a
list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added
myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in
other word lists is included.

The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
don't think can be copyrighted.

The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the
"Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon
File".  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain
a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the
special/ directory.

The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version
4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also
in the public domain.

The 60 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and all words
appearing in at least 2 of the 12 dictionaries as indicated by the
12Dicts package.  A large number of names are also included: The 4,946
female names and the 3,897 male names from the MWords package.

The 70 level includes the 74,550 common dictionary words and the
21,986 names list from the MWords package The common dictionary words,
like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections
added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of
the 12Dics package which is the public domain

The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the
ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics
Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words in from YAWL package,
and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.

The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper <thegrendel@theriver.com>,
is in the Public Domain:

  The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released
  into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in
  any manner they see fit. No fee or registration is required for its
  use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you feel you absolutely
  must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of
  the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your
  favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble
  community, as an alternate to "official" word lists. Game designers
  may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please
  mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note
  that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,
  you may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*
  legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
  WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict your
  rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only fair.

The 95 level includes the 354,984 single words and 256,772 compound
words from the MWords package, ABLE.LST from the ENABLE Supplement,
and some additional words found in my part-of-speech database that
were not found anywhere else.

                  GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3

   Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
   license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the
   terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
   supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

   As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the
   GNU General Public License.

   “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other
   than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

   An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by
   the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining
   a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using
   an interface provided by the Library.

   A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
   Version”.

   The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

   The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
   version:
     * a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
       to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
       function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
       whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
     * b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
       this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a
   header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
   code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
   material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts
   and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or
   fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
     * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
       Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
       by this License.
     * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
       license document.

4. Combined Works.

   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
   together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
   the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
   debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
     * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
       the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
       covered by this License.
     * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
       license document.
     * c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
       execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these
       notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of
       the GNU GPL and this license document.
     * d) Do one of the following:
          + 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
            this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
            suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
            recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
            the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
            manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
            Corresponding Source.
          + 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
            the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run
            time a copy of the Library already present on the user's
            computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
            version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
            Linked Version.
     * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
       otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
       of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
       necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined
       Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a
       modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the
       Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding
       Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,
       you must provide the Installation Information in the manner
       specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding
       Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
   side by side in a single library together with other library facilities
   that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and
   convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do
   both of the following:
     * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
       conveyed under the terms of this License.
     * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
       is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
       accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
   Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
   have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
   published version or of any later version published by the Free
   Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify
   a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
   choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
   published by the Free Software Foundation.

   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
   whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
   apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
   permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

                 GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the suc
cessor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.
1.]

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
   to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
   are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
   software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
   specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
   Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You
   can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
   this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
   strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
   below.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
   price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
   have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
   this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it
   if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
   in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
   things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
   distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
   rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
   you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or
   for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
   you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide
   complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
   with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
   it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
   library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
   permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there
   is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified
   by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what
   they have is not the original version, so that the original author's
   reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by
   others.

   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
   any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot
   effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
   restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any
   patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent
   with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
   GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public
   License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite
   different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license
   for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into
   non-free programs.

   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
   shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
   combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary
   General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
   entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General
   Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
   the library.

   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
   does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
   Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of
   an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are
   the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
   libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
   special circumstances.

   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
   encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
   becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be
   allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library
   does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case,
   there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software
   only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
   programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
   software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
   programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating
   system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
   users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
   linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that
   program using a modified version of the Library.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
   "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
   former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
   be combined with the library in order to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
   program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
   authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
   Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each
   licensee is addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
   has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"
   means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
   compilation and installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
   a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
   program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
   Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing
   it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
   program that uses the Library does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
   notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
   and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
   you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
   it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
   such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
   that you also meet all of these conditions:
     * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
     * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.
     * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
       invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in
       the event an application does not supply such function or table,
       the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
       purpose remains meaningful.
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
       purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
       function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
   scope of this License.

   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
   these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
   copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
   Library into a program that is not a library.

   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
   of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
   terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
   complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
   customarily used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
   a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
   code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
   source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
   source along with the object code.

   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
   but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked
   with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in
   isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls
   outside the scope of this License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section
   6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
   lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
   unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
   (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
   will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether
   or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link
   a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
   containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
   terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of
   the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
   debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
   of these things:
     * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
       the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)
     * b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
       copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
       rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
       will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
       the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
       interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
     * c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
       three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
       performing this distribution.
     * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.
     * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
   the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
   executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.

   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted,
   and provided that you do these two things:
     * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.
       This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
     * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
       find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
   from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
   long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
   Library or works based on it.

   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
   this License.

   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
   would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all
   those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
   only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
   entirely from distribution of the Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
   any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
   apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
   circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented
   by public license practices. Many people have made generous
   contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
   system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
   to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
   software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
   choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
   add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
   countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
   not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
   limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such
   new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
   version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
   Software Foundation.

   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
   Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
   guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
   derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse
   of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
   everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
   redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
   the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It
   is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
   effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
   at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
   found.
one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
   mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
   school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
   necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
   to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses
   are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
   software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
   specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
   other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your
   libraries, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
   Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
   freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
   service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
   want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
   free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
   to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
   restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
   distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or
   for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
   you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete
   object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the
   library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And
   you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the
   library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
   permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that
   everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library.
   If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
   recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so
   that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
   authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
   We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software
   will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming
   the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it
   clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
   licensed at all.

   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
   GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.
   This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to
   certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the
   ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that
   anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.

   The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
   they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding
   to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library,
   without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the
   library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application
   program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable
   is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the
   ordinary General Public License treats it as such.

   Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public
   License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing,
   because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that
   weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

   However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
   users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
   libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended
   to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
   preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
   libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to
   achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved
   it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope
   is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a
   "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The
   former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
   works together with the library.

   Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
   General Public License rather than by this special one.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
   party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
   General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is
   addressed as "you".

   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
   has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library"
   means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)

   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
   compilation and installation of the library.

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
   a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
   program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
   Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing
   it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
   program that uses the Library does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
   copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
   notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
   and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
   you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
   it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
   such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
   that you also meet all of these conditions:
     * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
     * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
     * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
       to all third parties under the terms of this License.
     * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
       invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in
       the event an application does not supply such function or table,
       the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its
       purpose remains meaningful.
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
       purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root
       function must still compute square roots.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Library.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
   scope of this License.

   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in
   these notices.

   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
   copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
   Library into a program that is not a library.

   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative
   of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the
   terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the
   complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be
   distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
   customarily used for software interchange.

   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from
   a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
   code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the
   source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
   source along with the object code.

   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
   but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked
   with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in
   isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls
   outside the scope of this License.

   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section
   6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten
   lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is
   unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
   (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
   will still fall under Section 6.)

   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether
   or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link
   a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
   containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under
   terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of
   the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for
   debugging such modifications.

   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
   of these things:
     * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
       the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)
     * b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least
       three years, to give the same user the materials specified in
       Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of
       performing this distribution.
     * c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.
     * d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,
   the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
   distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
   (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
   executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
   executable.

   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.

   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted,
   and provided that you do these two things:
     * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.
       This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
     * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
       part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
       find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
   otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
   Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
   from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
   long as such parties remain in full compliance.

   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
   Library or works based on it.

   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
   this License.

   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license
   would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all
   those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
   only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
   entirely from distribution of the Library.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
   any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
   apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
   circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented
   by public license practices. Many people have made generous
   contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
   system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
   to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
   software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
   choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
   add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
   countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
   not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
   limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such
   new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license
   version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
   Software Foundation.

   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
   Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
   guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
   derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse
   of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
   everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
   redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
   the ordinary General Public License).

   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It
   is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
   effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
   at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
   found.
one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) year  name of author

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Library General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the
Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor,
Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
   mail.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
   school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
   necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in

                      GNU General Public License Version 3

   Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
   license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
   and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
   to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
   the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
   share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
   free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use
   the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
   also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply
   it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
   Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
   freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if
   you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
   that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
   programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
   these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
   certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or
   if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
   you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
   source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
   rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1)
   assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
   you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
   that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
   authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
   changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
   authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
   modified versions of the software inside them, although the
   manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim
   of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic
   pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
   use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we
   have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for
   those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains,
   we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future
   versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
   States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
   software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
   avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
   make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that
   patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

   “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   “The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and
   “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

   To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
   an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the
   earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

   A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
   the Program.

   To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
   computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
   public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to
   the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
   feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
   tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
   extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
   work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the
   interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu,
   a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

   The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of
   a work.

   A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
   standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
   interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
   widely used among developers working in that language.

   The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
   than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
   packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
   Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
   Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
   implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major
   Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
   window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
   which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work,
   or an object code interpreter used to run it.

   The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the
   source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
   run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
   control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
   System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
   programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
   which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
   includes interface definition files associated with source files for
   the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
   linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
   such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
   subprograms and other parts of the work.

   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
   regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
   work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
   copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
   conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
   permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
   covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
   content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
   rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
   without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
   You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
   them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
   facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
   terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
   control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for
   you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
   control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
   copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
   conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
   it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
   measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
   11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
   laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
   circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
   respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
   operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
   the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
   circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
   receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
   keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
   non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
   keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
   recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
   you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
   produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
   of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
     * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
       it, and giving a relevant date.
     * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
       released under this License and any conditions added under section
       7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep
       intact all notices”.
     * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
       to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
       therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
       terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
       how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
       the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
       permission if you have separately received it.
     * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
       Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
       interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
       need not make them do so.

   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
   works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
   and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in
   or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
   “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used
   to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond
   what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an
   aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of
   the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
   sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
   Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
   ways:
     * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
       Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
       used for software interchange.
     * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
       (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
       written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long
       as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
       model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
       copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
       product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
       medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
       more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
       conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source
       from a network server at no charge.
     * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
       written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
       is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
       received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
       subsection 6b.
     * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
       place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
       Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
       further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
       Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
       copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
       may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
       that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
       clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
       Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
       Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
       available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
     * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
       you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
       Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
       charge under subsection 6d.

   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
   from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included
   in conveying the object code work.

   A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
   tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
   or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
   incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
   consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
   coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,
   “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of
   product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
   in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
   to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of
   whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
   non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode
   of use of the product.

   “Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
   procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
   install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
   Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The
   information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
   the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
   solely because modification has been made.

   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
   specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
   part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
   User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
   fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
   Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by
   the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if
   neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified
   object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been
   installed in ROM).

   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
   requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
   updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
   recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
   installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification
   itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or
   violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
   in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
   documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
   source code form), and must require no special password or key for
   unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

   “Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
   License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
   Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
   be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
   that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
   apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
   under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
   this License without regard to the additional permissions.

   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove
   any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.
   (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in
   certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional
   permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you
   have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
   add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
   of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
     * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
       terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
     * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
       author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
       Notices displayed by works containing it; or
     * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
       requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
       reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
     * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
       authors of the material; or
     * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
       trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
     * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
       material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions
       of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
       for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly
       impose on those licensors and authors.

   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
   restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
   received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
   governed by this License along with a term that is a further
   restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a
   further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
   License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
   of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
   not survive such relicensing or conveying.

   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
   must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional
   terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find
   the applicable terms.

   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
   form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
   above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
   provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
   modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
   this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
   paragraph of section 11).

   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
   from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
   unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
   your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
   notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
   after the cessation.

   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
   permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
   some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
   of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder,
   and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the
   notice.

   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
   licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
   this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
   reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
   material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
   a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
   occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
   receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing
   other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify
   any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
   this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
   you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
   receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
   propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
   for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

   An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
   organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
   organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
   work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction
   who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the
   work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the
   previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding
   Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor
   has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
   rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not
   impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights
   granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
   any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
   sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

   A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
   License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
   work thus licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.

   A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned
   or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
   acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this
   License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do
   not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
   further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this
   definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in
   a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
   propagate the contents of its contributor version.

   In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
   agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
   (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
   sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a
   party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
   patent against the party.

   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
   and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
   copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
   publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
   then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
   available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
   patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
   consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
   license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have
   actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
   covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
   in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
   country that you have reason to believe are valid.

   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
   arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
   covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
   receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
   or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
   you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
   work and works based on it.

   A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the
   scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
   the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
   granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you
   are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
   business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
   third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work,
   and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
   receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a)
   in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or
   copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection
   with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,
   unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was
   granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any
   implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be
   available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
   covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
   this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
   you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
   obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to
   whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
   terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
   Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
   permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
   under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
   combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
   License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
   but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
   section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
   combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
   the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
   License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
   of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
   Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public
   License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
   Foundation.

   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
   of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public
   statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
   choose that version for the Program.

   Later license versions may give you additional or different
   permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
   author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
   later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
   APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
   HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT
   WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
   LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
   OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
   ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
   WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
   CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
   INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
   ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
   NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
   SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
   OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
   HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
   above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
   reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
   an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
   Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
   copy of the Program in return for a fee.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
   free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
   terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
   attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
   the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
   “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
 Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

 This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 (at your option) any later version.

 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.

 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
   mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice
   like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
 <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
 This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
 This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
 under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
   appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your
   program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
   use an “about box”.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
   school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if
   necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
   the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
   program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
   library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
   applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the
   GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first,
   please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

                      GNU General Public License Version 2

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
   to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
   intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
   software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
   General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
   Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
   using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
   the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
   your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
   Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
   freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
   service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
   want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
   free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
   to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
   restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
   distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
   have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
   (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
   distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
   that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
   software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
   want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
   that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
   authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
   We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
   individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
   proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
   must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
   refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
   means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
   language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
   the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
   the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
   (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
   is true depends on what the Program does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
   and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
   this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
   recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
   Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
   you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
   it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
   such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
   that you also meet all of these conditions:

          a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
          b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
          any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
          third parties under the terms of this License.
          c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
          announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
          notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
          under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
          of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
          interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
          your work based on the Program is not required to print an
          announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
   with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
   scope of this License.

   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
   under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

          a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
          interchange; or,
          b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
          c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
          offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
          is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with such
          an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
   code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
   associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
   compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
   exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
   is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
   major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
   on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
   to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
   copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
   source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
   source along with the object code.

   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.

   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
   Program or works based on it.

   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
   on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
   would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all
   those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
   only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
   entirely from distribution of the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
   any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
   apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
   circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
   implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
   contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
   system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
   to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
   software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
   choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
   add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
   countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
   not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
   limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
   to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.

   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
   free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
   terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
   attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
   the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
   "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) yyyy name of author

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
   mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
   when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
   appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
   commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
   c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
   program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
   school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
   necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
   into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
   may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
   with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU
   Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

       infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by
       that Contributor.

3. Distribution Obligations.

  3.1. Application of License.

   The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
   governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
   Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed
   only under the terms of this License or a future version of this
   License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
   License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
   offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
   restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
   rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
   offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

  3.2. Availability of Source Code.

   Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
   made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
   either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
   Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
   Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
   Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
   months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
   (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
   has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
   ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
   Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

  3.3. Description of Modifications.

   You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
   file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
   the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
   Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
   provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
   Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
   Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
   origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

  3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

    (a) Third Party Claims

   If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
   intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted
   by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include
   a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which
   describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail
   that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
   knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
   Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
   copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other
   steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
   reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code
   that new knowledge has been obtained.

    (b) Contributor APIs

   If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
   interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are
   reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also
   include this information in the legal file.

    (c) Representations.

   Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section
   3.4 (a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
   are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has
   sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

  3.5. Required Notices.

   You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
   Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
   Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
   location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
   look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
   may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
   A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
   Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights
   relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
   for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
   more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your
   own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
   Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
   You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
   Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
   Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
   terms You offer.

  3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

   You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
   requirements of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for
   that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source
   Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
   License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled
   the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously
   included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation
   or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
   Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code
   or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain
   terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
   with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable
   version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in
   the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
   You distribute the Executable version under a different license You
   must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this
   License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
   Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
   every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
   or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

  3.7. Larger Works.

   You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
   not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
   Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
   requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
   judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms
   of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
   limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included
   in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with
   all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited
   by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
   detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
   attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

  6.1. New Versions

   Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
   and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will
   be given a distinguishing version number.

  6.2. Effect of New Versions

   Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
   License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
   version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
   of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
   other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
   Covered Code created under this License.

  6.3. Derivative Works

   If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
   only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
   governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the
   phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or
   any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to
   note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise
   make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which
   differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License.
   (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
   Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
   themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. Disclaimer of warranty

   Covered code is provided under this license on an "as is" basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including,
   without limitation, warranties that the covered code is free of
   defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
   The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered code
   is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect,
   you (not the initial developer or any other contributor) assume the
   cost of any necessary servicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer
   of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. No use of
   any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8. Termination

   8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
   such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
   sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
   survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
   nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
   shall survive.

   8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
   claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial
   Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
   against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")
   alleging that:
    a. such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
       infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
       Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
       shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
       prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You
       either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
       agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
       Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
       litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
       such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty
       and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by
       the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights
       granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
       automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
       period specified above.
    b. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
       Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
       then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections
       2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first
       made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
       that Participant.

   8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
   alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
   indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
   by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
   infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
   granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
   into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
   license.

   8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all
   end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
   which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
   prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. Limitation of liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
   (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial
   developer, any other contributor, or any distributor of covered code,
   or any supplier of any of such parties, be liable to any person for any
   indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
   character including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
   commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
   informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of
   liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
   resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law
   prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
   exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this
   exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.

10. U.S. government end users

   The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
   C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"
   and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are
   used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
   and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S.
   Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
   forth herein.

11. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
   California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
   provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
   respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
   entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of
   America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
   the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
   California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with
   the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation,
   court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
   application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
   International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
   regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
   construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. Responsibility for claims

   As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
   responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out
   of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work
   with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
   responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
   shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. Multiple-licensed code

   Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
   "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
   Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
   Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
   by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

2. License Grants and Conditions

  2.1. Grants

   Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license:
    a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
       Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
       modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
       Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications,
       or as part of a Larger Work; and
    b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
       for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
       Contributions or its Contributor Version.

  2.2. Effective Date

   The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
   become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor
   first distributes such Contribution.

  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

   The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted
   under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied
   from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this
   License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
   granted by a Contributor:
    a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
       or
    b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
       modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
       Contributions with other software (except as part of its
       Contributor Version); or
    c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
       its Contributions.

   This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service
   marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to
   comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

   No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
   distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
   License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License
   (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

  2.5. Representation

   Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
   Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
   to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

  2.6. Fair Use

   This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
   applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
   equivalents.

  2.7. Conditions

   Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
   in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities

  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

   All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
   Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
   the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
   Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
   License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
   attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code
   Form.

  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

   If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
    a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
       Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients
       of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source
       Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no
       more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
    b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
       License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
       license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
       the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

   You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
   provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
   the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
   Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and
   the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
   License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
   under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
   the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
   Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
   License(s).

  3.4. Notices

   You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
   (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
   or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
   the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
   the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

   You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
   Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
   behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
   such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered
   by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for
   any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty,
   support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include
   additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability
   specific to any jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
   must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the
   Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by
   statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
   for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination

   5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
   if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
   compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
   Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on
   an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
   non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
   come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
   notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is
   the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this
   License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30
   days after Your receipt of the notice.

   5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a
   patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
   counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
   directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
   You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under
   Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

   5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
   end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
   which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this
   License prior to termination shall survive termination.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis,
   without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
   including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
   free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
   non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
   the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
   defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of
   any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
   warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any
   Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
   disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability

   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
   (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
   or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be
   liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
   damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
   failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
   losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
   of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
   liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s
   negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
   jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
   consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply
   to You.

8. Litigation

   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
   courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
   place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
   Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring
   cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous

   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
   that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
   shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License

  10.1. New Versions

   Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in
   Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
   modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be
   given a distinguishing version number.

  10.2. Effect of New Versions

   You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
   of the License under which You originally received the Covered
   Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the
   license steward.

  10.3. Modified Versions

   If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
   create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
   modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
   any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
   such modified license differs from this License).

  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

   If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
   Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
   notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

     This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
     License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
     file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

   If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
   file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
   file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
   for such a notice.

   You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

Exhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice

     This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”, as
     defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

             SIL Open Font License Version 1.1 – 26 February 2007

   PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate
   worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the
   font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to
   provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and
   improved in partnership with others.

   The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
   redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
   fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that the font
   names of derivative works are changed. The fonts and derivatives,
   however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
   requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
   any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

   DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the
   Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This
   may include source files, build scripts and documentation.

   "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
   copyright statement(s).

   "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
   as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

   "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to,
   deleting, or substituting – in part or in whole -- any of the
   components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting
   the Font Software to a new environment.

   "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer
   or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

   PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge,
   to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study,
   copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and
   unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following
   conditions:

   1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in
   Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

   2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
   contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
   included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in
   the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary
   files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
   Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the
   corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the
   primary font name as presented to the users.

   4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
   Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
   Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
   Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
   permission.

   5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
   be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed
   under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
   license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.

   TERMINATION This license becomes null and void if any of the above
   conditions are not met.

   DISCLAIMER THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
   ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
   NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT. IN NO
   EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR
   OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
   OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
   OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT
   SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.

   are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
   combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
   Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
   against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
   lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within

   any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work
   shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
   or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
   following conditions:

       notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
       that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
    4. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
       such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
       any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following
       places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the

       provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
       generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party
       notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
       informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
       add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
       distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
       Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be
       construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright
       statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
       different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
       distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative

       License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
   You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this
   License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding

   separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor
   regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
   to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
   provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
   CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
   MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
   responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
   redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
   exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless
   required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
   acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
   for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
   License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but
   not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
   failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
   losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility
   of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
   fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
   obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in
   accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
   Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
   only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
   harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
   such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or
   additional liability.

LPPL Version 1.3c  2008-05-04

Copyright 1999 2002-2008 LaTeX3 Project
    Everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but modification of it is not allowed.


PREAMBLE
========

The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under
which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.

You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly
suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but
it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is
unrelated to TeX.

The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',
below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors
who are considering distributing their works under this license.

This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
that work may be distributed.

We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work
that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'
and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.


DEFINITIONS
===========

In this license document the following terms are used:

   `Work'
    Any work being distributed under this License.

   `Derived Work'
    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.

   `Modification'
    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language.

   `Modify'
    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
    applicable law.

   `Distribution'
    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in
    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)
    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file
    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).

   `Compiled Work'
    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it
    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may
    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation
    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.

   `Current Maintainer'
    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is
    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under
    any applicable law.

   `Base Interpreter'
    A program or process that is normally needed for running or
    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.

    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these
    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each
    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the
    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a
    `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the
    `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.



CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===========================================

1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work
are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In
particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.

2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.

3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
directly from the Work.

4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may
also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including
Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works
distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to
be updated versions of the Work.

5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify
your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,
and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on
the Derived Work.

6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states
in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only
the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption
to a component of the Work.

  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement
     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the
     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that
     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work
     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version
     of this component to the user when used interactively with that
     Base Interpreter.

  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a
     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part
     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log
     of the changes.

  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version
     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the
     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that
     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.

  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:

       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work;
          if your distribution of a modified component is made by
          offering access to copy the modified component from a
          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to
          copy the Work along with the modified component;

       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
          unmodified copy of the Work.

7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as
the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled
Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with
regard to the Derived Work.

8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as
it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.

9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is
then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or
nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of
applying that process.

10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in
       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have
       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.

    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of
       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the
       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.

11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
such works with the Work by any means.

12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.


NO WARRANTY
===========

There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in
writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume
the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the
Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of
the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited
to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by
anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other
programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other
party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.


MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
=======================

The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in
the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder
or simply that it is `author-maintained'.

The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer
who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error
reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail
address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge
or act upon these error reports.

The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
significant signs of active maintenance.

You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.

If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of
the Work through the following steps:

 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and
     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of
     an Internet or similar search.

 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work
     is still maintained.

  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer
     to update their communication data within one month.

  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce
     within the pertinent community your intention to take over
     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be
     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)

 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect
     immediately upon announcement.

  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright
     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,
     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.

 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by
     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other
     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as
     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.

 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
     reachable once more within three months of a change completed
     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must
     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided
     they then update their communication data within one month.

A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact
that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.

If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also
announce your new status to the same pertinent community as
in 2b) above.


WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
======================================================

This section contains important instructions, examples, and
recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in
this section.

Choosing This License or Another License
----------------------------------------

If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*
conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then
do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text
of this license as a model for your own license, but your license
should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
your work is distributed under the LPPL.

The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains
the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,
for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is
unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be
relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any
license are encouraged to read it.

A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
-----------------------------------------------------

It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own
personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such
modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by
accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or
it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions
of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,
cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your
best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public
one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work
without altering any of its licensed components.

How to Use This License
-----------------------

To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both
an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work
was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a
statement that the distribution and/or modification of that
component is constrained by the conditions in this license.

Here is an example of such a notice and statement:

  %% pig.dtx
  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
  %
  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
  % The latest version of this license is in
  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
  % version 2005/12/01 or later.
  %
  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
  %
  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
  %
  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
  % and the derived file pig.sty.

Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions
given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring
to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being
generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and
`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.

If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your
Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.
However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance
section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to
the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
yourself.

Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
---------------------------------------

Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and
stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves
with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a
(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If
this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a
completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.


Important Recommendations
-------------------------

 Defining What Constitutes the Work

   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the
   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a
   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.
   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the
   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by
   using a line such as:

    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.

   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be
   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise
   the Work.

License

   THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
   CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
   PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
   OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
   PROHIBITED.

   BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
   AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
   LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
   RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
   AND CONDITIONS.

   1. Definitions
    a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
       other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
       derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
       literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
       cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
       be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
       recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
       constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
       the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
       Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
       synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
       ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
       this License.
    b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
       as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
       broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
       listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
       arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations,
       in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form
       along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
       separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
       assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
       Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined below)
       for the purposes of this License.
    c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
       listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has
       been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent
       to this License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i)
       contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as
       the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits
       the relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that
       license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction
       license with the same License Elements as this License.
    d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
       copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
       other transfer of ownership.
    e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
       attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of
       this License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
    f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
       that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
    g. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
       work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
       the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the
       publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the
       actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
       sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
       literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
       case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
       who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
       (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits
       the broadcast.
    h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
       terms of this License including without limitation any production
       in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
       the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as
       a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
       other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
       work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
       composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
       are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
       cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
       sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
       are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
       photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
       sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
       architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
       compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
       copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
       performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
       or artistic work.
    i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
       License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
       with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
       from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
       previous violation.
    j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
       and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
       means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
       digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
       a way that members of the public may access these Works from a
       place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the
       Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to
       the public of the performances of the Work, including by public
       digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
       means including signs, sounds or images.
    k. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
       without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
       fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage
       of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
       electronic medium.

   2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
   limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
   limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
   copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

   3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
    a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
       Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
       Collections;
    b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
       Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
       reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
       that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
       translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
       English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
       work has been modified.";
    c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
       incorporated in Collections; and,
    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
    e. For the avoidance of doubt:
         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
            any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
            the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
            royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
            this License;
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
            the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
            by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
            the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
            administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
            from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
            License.

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
   known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
   such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
   in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
   expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

   4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
   made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
    a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
       terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
       Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
       Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
       impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
       License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
       rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
       You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices
       that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
       every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You
       Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
       effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the
       ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
       granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
       Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection,
       but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself
       to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
       Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
       practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by
       Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon
       notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
       remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c),
       as requested.
    b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
       terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
       with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
       Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
       version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
       (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
       Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
       licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
       license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of
       the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
       License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
       generally and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy
       of, or the URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each
       Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not
       offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms
       of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the
       Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
       the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all
       notices that refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer
       of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
       Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You
       Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose
       any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
       restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
       exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
       the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation
       as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
       Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to
       the terms of the Applicable License.
    c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
       or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant
       to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
       provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
       the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
       supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
       another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
       entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
       Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
       reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title
       of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably
       practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
       associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
       copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) ,
       consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
       credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
       "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
       based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
       this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
       provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection,
       at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
       contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then
       as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
       the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance
       of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for
       the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
       exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly
       or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
       endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
       Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
       the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
       Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
    d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
       otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
       or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
       Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
       or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
       be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
       Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
       any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
       (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
       mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
       the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
       or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
       permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
       reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
       (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

   5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
   OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
   KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
   INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
   LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
   ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
   THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
   YOU.

   6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
   LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
   ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
   ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
   HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   7. Termination
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
       Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
       their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
       remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
       7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
       is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
       Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
       release the Work under different license terms or to stop
       distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
       election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
       license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
       terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
       force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

   8. Miscellaneous
    a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
       Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
       Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
       under this License.
    b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
       Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
       the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
       this License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
       of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
       action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
       reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
       valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
       breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
       writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
       consent.
    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
       with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
       understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
       Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
       additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
       You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
       agreement of the Licensor and You.
    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
       this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
       Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
       amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
       WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
       Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
       on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in
       the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
       be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
       implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
       national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
       applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
       under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
       included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict
       the license of any rights under applicable law.
