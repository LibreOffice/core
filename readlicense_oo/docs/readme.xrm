				<p class="note" id="edssc3d" xml:lang="en-US">Please be aware that administrator rights are needed for the installation process.</p>
				<p id="MSOReg1" xml:lang="en-US">Registration of ${PRODUCTNAME} as default application for Microsoft Office formats can be forced or suppressed by using the following command line switches with the installer:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p id="MSOReg2" xml:lang="en-US"><tt>REGISTER_ALL_MSO_TYPES=1</tt> will force registration of ${PRODUCTNAME} as default application for Microsoft Office formats.</p>

				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="LINUX" id="Linuxi2">
			    <p id="s2we10" xml:lang="en-US">As a general rule, you are recommended to install ${PRODUCTNAME} via the installation methods recommended by your particular Linux distribution (such as the Ubuntu Software Center, in the case of Ubuntu Linux). This is because it is usually the simplest way to obtain an installation that is optimally integrated into your system. Indeed, ${PRODUCTNAME} may well be already installed by default when you originally install your Linux operating system.</p>
				<p id="s2we11" xml:lang="en-US">This "stand-alone" ${PRODUCTNAME} installer is provided for users in need of previews, having special needs, and for out-of-the-ordinary cases.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p id="s2we35" xml:lang="en-US">Linux Kernel version 2.6.18 or higher;</p>

					</li>
				</ul>
				<p id="Linuxi3a" xml:lang="en-US">There is a wide variety of Linux distributions, and there may be different installation options (KDE vs Gnome, etc.) available from the same Linux vendor. Some distributions ship with their own “native” version of ${PRODUCTNAME}, which may have different features from this community-supplied version of ${PRODUCTNAME}. In many cases, you can install the community-supplied ${PRODUCTNAME} alongside a native version. However, you may prefer to remove the “native” version before installing this community-supplied version. For details on how to do that, please consult the user help resources provided by your particular Linux vendor.</p>
				<p class="note" id="Linuxi4a" xml:lang="en-US">It is a recommended best practice to back-up your system and data before you remove or install software.</p>
			</div>
			<p id="Precautions" xml:lang="en-US">Please make sure you have enough free memory in the temporary directory on your system, and please ensure that read, write and run access rights have been granted. Close all other programs before starting the installation process.</p>
			<h3 id="sdfsdfgf42s" xml:lang="en-US">Installation of ${PRODUCTNAME} on Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux systems</h3>
			<p id="debianinstall1" xml:lang="en-US">For instructions on how to install a language pack (after having installed the US English version of ${PRODUCTNAME}), please read the section below entitled Installing a Language Pack.</p>
			<p id="debianinstall2" xml:lang="en-US">When you unpack the downloaded archive, you will see that the contents have been decompressed into a sub-directory. Open a file manager window, and change directory to the one starting with "LibreOffice_", followed by the version number and some platform information.</p>
			<p id="debianinstall3" xml:lang="en-US">This directory contains a subdirectory called "DEBS". Change directory to the "DEBS" directory.</p>
			<p id="debianinstall4" xml:lang="en-US">Right-click within the directory and choose "Open in Terminal". A terminal window will open. From the command line of the terminal window, enter the following command (you will be prompted to enter your root user's password before the command will execute):</p>
			<p id="debianinstall5" xml:lang="en-US">The following commands will install LibreOffice and the desktop integration packages (you may just copy and paste them into the terminal screen rather than trying to type them):</p>
			<p id="debianinstall6" xml:lang="en-US">sudo dpkg -i *.deb</p>
			<p id="debianinstall9" xml:lang="en-US">The installation process is now completed, and you should have icons for all the ${PRODUCTNAME} applications in your desktop's Applications/Office menu.</p>
			<h3 id="sdfsdfgf42t" xml:lang="en-US">Installation of ${PRODUCTNAME} on Fedora, openSUSE, Mandriva and other Linux systems using RPM packages</h3>
			<p id="rpminstall1" xml:lang="en-US">For instructions on how to install a language pack (after having installed the US English version of ${PRODUCTNAME}), please read the section below entitled Installing a Language Pack.</p>
			<p id="rpminstall2" xml:lang="en-US">When you unpack the downloaded archive, you will see that the contents have been decompressed into a sub-directory. Open a file manager window, and change directory to the one starting with "LibreOffice_", followed by the version number and some platform information.</p>
			<p id="rpminstall3" xml:lang="en-US">This directory contains a subdirectory called "RPMS". Change directory to the "RPMS" directory.</p>
			<p id="rpminstall4" xml:lang="en-US">Right-click within the directory and choose "Open in Terminal". A terminal window will open. From the command line of the terminal window, enter the following command (you will be prompted to enter your root user's password before the command will execute):</p>
			<p id="rpminstall5" xml:lang="en-US">For Fedora-based systems: su -c 'yum install *.rpm'</p>
			<p id="rpminstall6" xml:lang="en-US">For Mandriva-based systems: sudo urpmi *.rpm</p>
			<p id="rpminstall7" xml:lang="en-US">For other RPM-based systems (openSUSE, etc.): rpm -Uvh *.rpm</p>
			<p id="rpminstallE" xml:lang="en-US">The installation process is now completed, and you should have icons for all the ${PRODUCTNAME} applications in your desktop's Applications/Office menu.</p>
			<p id="rpminstall7a" xml:lang="en-US">Alternatively, you can use the 'install' script, located in the toplevel directory of this archive to perform an installation as a user. The script will set up ${PRODUCTNAME} to have its own profile for this installation, separated from your normal ${PRODUCTNAME} profile. Note that this will not install the system integration parts such as desktop menu items and desktop MIME type registrations.</p>
			<h3 id="sdfsdfgf42t2" xml:lang="en-US">Notes Concerning Desktop Integration for Linux Distributions Not Covered in the Above Installation Instructions</h3>
			<p id="otherinstall1" xml:lang="en-US">It should be easily possible to install ${PRODUCTNAME} on other Linux distributions not specifically covered in these installation instructions. The main aspect for which differences might be encountered is desktop integration.</p>
			<p id="otherinstall2" xml:lang="en-US">The RPMS (or DEBS, respectively) directory also contains a package named libreoffice${PRODUCTVERSION}-freedesktop-menus-${PRODUCTVERSION}.0.1-1.noarch.rpm (or libreoffice${PRODUCTVERSION}-debian-menus_${PRODUCTVERSION}.0.1-1_all.deb, respectively, or similar). This is a package for all Linux distributions that support the Freedesktop.org specifications/recommendations (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedesktop.org">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedesktop.org</a>), and is provided for installation on other Linux distributions not covered in the aforementioned instructions.</p>
			<h3 id="sdfsdfgf42t3" xml:lang="en-US">Installing a Language Pack</h3>
			<p id="linuxlangpack1" xml:lang="en-US">Download the language pack for your desired language and platform. They are available from the same location as the main installation archive. From the Nautilus file manager, extract the downloaded archive into a directory (your desktop, for instance). Ensure that you have exited all ${PRODUCTNAME} applications (including the QuickStarter, if it is started).</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpack2" xml:lang="en-US">Change directory to the directory in which you extracted your downloaded language pack.</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpack3" xml:lang="en-US">Now change directory to the directory that was created during the extraction process. For instance, for the French language pack for a 32-bit Debian/Ubuntu-based system, the directory is named LibreOffice_, plus some version information, plus Linux_x86_langpack-deb_fr.</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpack4" xml:lang="en-US">Now change directory to the directory that contains the packages to install. On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, the directory will be DEBS. On Fedora, openSUSE or Mandriva systems, the directory will be RPMS.</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpack5" xml:lang="en-US">From the Nautilus file manager, right-click in the directory and choose the command "Open in terminal". In the terminal window you just opened, execute the command to install the language pack (with all of the commands below, you may be prompted to enter your root user's password):</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpack6" xml:lang="en-US">For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems: sudo dpkg -i *.deb</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpack7" xml:lang="en-US">For Fedora-based systems: su -c 'yum install *.rpm'</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpack8" xml:lang="en-US">For Mandriva-based systems: sudo urpmi *.rpm</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpack9" xml:lang="en-US">For other RPM-using systems (openSUSE, etc.): rpm -Uvh *.rpm</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpackA" xml:lang="en-US">Now start one of the ${PRODUCTNAME} applications - Writer, for instance. Go to the Tools menu and choose Options. In the Options dialog box, click on "Language Settings" and then click on "Languages". Dropdown the "User interface" list and select the language you just installed. If you want, do the same thing for the "Locale setting", the "Default currency", and the "Default languages for documents".</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpackB" xml:lang="en-US">After adjusting those settings, click on OK. The dialog box will close, and you will see an information message telling you that your changes will only be activated after you exit ${PRODUCTNAME} and start it again (remember to also exit the QuickStarter if it is started).</p>
			<p id="linuxlangpackC" xml:lang="en-US">The next time you start ${PRODUCTNAME}, it will start in the language you just installed.</p>

			<p id="abcdef" xml:lang="en-US">Difficulties starting ${PRODUCTNAME} (e.g. applications hang) as well as problems with the screen display are often caused by the graphics card driver. If these problems occur, please update your graphics card driver or try using the graphics driver delivered with your operating system. Difficulties displaying 3D objects can often be solved by deactivating the option "Use OpenGL" under 'Tools - Options - ${PRODUCTNAME} - View - 3D view'.</p>

			<p id="w32e1" xml:lang="en-US">Only shortcut keys (key combinations) not used by the operating system can be used in ${PRODUCTNAME}. If a key combination in ${PRODUCTNAME} does not work as described in the ${PRODUCTNAME} Help, check if that shortcut is already used by the operating system. To rectify such conflicts, you can change the keys assigned by your operating system. Alternatively, you can change almost any key assignment in ${PRODUCTNAME}. For more information on this topic, refer to the ${PRODUCTNAME} Help or the Help documentation of your operating system.</p>

			<p id="pji76w" xml:lang="en-US">File locking is enabled by default in ${PRODUCTNAME}. On a network that uses the Network File System protocol (NFS), the locking daemon for NFS clients must be active. To disable file locking, edit the <tt>soffice</tt> script and change the line "<tt>export SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING</tt>" to "<tt># export SAL_ENABLE_FILE_LOCKING</tt>".
