The problem with that approach is that e.g. Fedora builds with pdfium disabled, but pdfium is enabled on ~all tinderboxes, so nobody sees those failures before a release. My hope is that if this is a runtime check, then we don\u0027t have to maintain these stubs in parallel. But if you think even removing HAVE_FEATURE_PDFIUM is going too far, we could introduce it back, just for testcase purposes.\n\nSee e.g. 6546dcda7ee6136d41d56f757fed87f2919c3290 fixing the disable-pdfium build.",

Yes, I think it would arguably be better to bring it back and use it here.  I can eventually take care of that.",
