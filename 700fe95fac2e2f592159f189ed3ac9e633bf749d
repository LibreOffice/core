      "message": "That\u0027s what we had before, a forest of HAVE_FEATURE_PDFIUM ifdefs, see e.g. commit faf3f18bdc89cc5e04abdefcb12d63e6ef796396. The problem with that approach is that e.g. Fedora builds with pdfium disabled, but pdfium is enabled on ~all tinderboxes, so nobody sees those failures before a release. My hope is that if this is a runtime check, then we don\u0027t have to maintain these stubs in parallel. But if you think even removing HAVE_FEATURE_PDFIUM is going too far, we could introduce it back, just for testcase purposes.\n\nSee e.g. 6546dcda7ee6136d41d56f757fed87f2919c3290 fixing the disable-pdfium build.",
