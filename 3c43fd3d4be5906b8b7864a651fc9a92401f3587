      "message": "So in order to make the tests more thorough and more specialized for each png file, I made each test case optionally take a std::vector\u003cstd::function\u003c\u003e\u003e. This way I can pass a bunch of assert functions I want to each test, and they can be different for each test but common ones can be reused.\n\nThis is not the final result ofc. But I want to hear your thoughts, is this a good approach? If not let me know so I don\u0027t continue because this is going to be a pretty big one since there\u0027s so many files to specialize tests for.\n\nPS: This does work. For example if you bind the wrong values to fAssertSize the test will fail (see line 455)",
