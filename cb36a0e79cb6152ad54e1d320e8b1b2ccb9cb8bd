      "message": "you are changing the declaration of drawEPS but not the definition in gdiimpl.cxx - this will break the 64-bit windows build, please adapt definition too.\n\nactually - wait a second - this is an override and there is a super-class that uses the \"sal_uLong\" type for this parameter, which is *also* deprecated and the same as sal_uIntPtr - you need to replace this type in about a dozen different platform specific drawEPS declarations at the same time.",
