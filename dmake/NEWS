News file for the dmake version that is hosted on the OpenOffice.org
cvs. #i<number># denote issues tracked by the OpenOffice.org issue tracking
system, see <http://qa.openoffice.org/issue_handling/project_issues.html>.

Version 4.5
===========

Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i66385# Fix the handling of .<suffix> targets. Always treat these targets
as meta targets regardless of the AUGMAKE (-A) status. Previously this was
enabled when the AUGMAKE was *not* set to 'yes' or the -A switch was given.

#i66083# We now stop with an error if AUGMAKE meta targets and regular
targets are used in one rule definition. As the syntax of these target
definitions is slightly different this hints to an error in the makefile,
most probably a misspelled attribute or special target.

#i48087#, #i64869# The parsing of %-target definitions was fixed and
enhanced. Prior to dmake 4.5 only one %-target per target-definition worked
reliably, now this works well, but to help projects that still use older
versions a warning was added.

It's not very nice to issue a warning for something that works now but
didn't before. This was only done to aid development and will probably
be removed in future versions.

There was, and still is, that for a bug in dmake for %-targets with more
than one (not indirect) prerequisite only the first prerequisite is used.
This will be fixed in future versions but until this happens we issue a
warning that prerequisites are ignored.

#i65122# The :| rule operator was handled differently from what the man
page said. The man page was adapted to reflect reality. Changing dmakes
behavior to match the man page would have introduced a lot of compatibility
issues.

Version 4.4
===========

2006/02/03 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i61170# Fix the TMD macro. Up to now the TMD macro appended a directory
separator if it ended in "..", but most of the time it was not set correctly
at all and/or without a trailing slash.
Note: If your application relies on TMD please check the dmake manual page
for its definition and fix your makefiles if needed.

2006/02/01 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i60948# Add -m option family to generate timing information for targets
and/or recipes.

2005/09/19 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i53148# Fix $(shell ...) macro picking up the output of earlier
recipe lines in parallel builds.
#i54766# Ensure that all previous recipe lines to a recipe
line containing a $(shell ...) macro have finished before executing
the macro in parallel builds.

2005/06/01 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i39248# Add a testsuite to test some dmake features (only for autotools
builds). Start the tests with "make check".

2005/04/21 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i47851# Increase the version number to 4.4-cvs and slightly rearrange the
output of "dmake -V".
Remove the hard-coded (in autotools builds) OS macro. It had the wrong value
to be usable with the startup/*.mk and is not mentioned in the man page.
Clean up configure.in and friends.

2005/04/20 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i43310# Fix percent (%) rules to recognize prerequisites that are defined
with the multiple target rule operator (::). 
This implicitly fixes the similar problem for .<suffix>.<suffix> targets.

2005/04/16 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i46987# Fix the documentation of the $(mktmp ...) function macro. This is
not necessarily a new feature as the macro works this way since dmake was
imported into the OpenOffice.org cvs but mentioning it here might help users
of dmake upgrading from very old versions.

Add the "map escape codes" $(...:m) macro expansion that allows to expand
escape codes in macros.  It can also be used to reproduce the former (pre
OpenOffice.org cvs) $(mktmp ...) behavior.

2005/04/10 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i43252# Introduce the macro ABSMAKECMD that's value for a native Windows
dmake executable (compiled with MS Visual C++ or MinGW) is the absolute
filename and NULL for other operating systems or dmake build with other
compilers.
If DMAKEROOT is not changed and only for native Windows dmake versions the
value of DMAKEROOT now defaults to "$(ABSMAKECMD:d)startup".
This allows to use the startup files from the startup directory from the
same location where the dmake.exe is located.

2005/04/08 Steve Hay (shay@openoffice.org)
#i43241# Fix build problems with VC++ (in non-OOo environment) and fix
the dmake makefiles so that dmake can rebuild itself (VC++ only).

2005/03/14 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i44959# Fix problems when a continued line is followed by an empty
or comment line.

2005/03/13 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i37053# Fix function macro problems with continued lines.

2004/11/23 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i37491# Predefine dmake macro containing one space (SPACECHAR).

2004/11/21 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i36027# Improve function macro parameter parsing.

Version 4.3
===========

2004/10/07 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i34746# Fix timestamp of phony targets with prerequisites.

2004/07/11 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i31255# Add verbose recipe echoing option (-vr).

2004/07/06 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i30779# Fix to allow dmake to echo recipe lines when inference is used
to create files that are to be read by .INCLUDE.

2004/04/01 Michael Meeks (mmeeks@openoffice.org)
#i27319#, #i27981# Don't handle environment variables that begin with a
'!', they are used by Cygwin internally and confuse dmake.

2004/01/09 Dan Williams (fa@openoffice.org)
#i17992# Allows the nesting of expressions and a much more complex syntax
for dmake. It is now possible to nest expressions with () and any
combination of || and &&.
Example:
.IF (("$(OS)"=="MACOSX"&&"$(COM)"=="GCC")||"$(OS)"=="LINUX") && "$(GUIBASE)"=="unx"
...
.ENDIF

2003/10/19 Ken Foskey (waratah@openoffice.org)
#i20504# Correct processing of .LIBRARY targets.

2003/10/08 Chris Halls (haggai@openoffice.org)
#i7800# Fix tempnam security problem.

2003/03/08 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i10910# Use the build-in tempnam function for MS VC6.

2003/03/05 Volker Quetschke (vq@openoffice.org)
#i11861# Switch to newer autotools autoconf 2.5x and automake 1.5 and
add MinGW and MSVC to the configure buildable targets.

2002/10/11 Ken Foskey (waratah@openoffice.org)
Fix the "lost a child" problem. (Part II)

2002/10/04 Ken Foskey (waratah@openoffice.org)
Rework the configure process.

2002/04/10 Hans-Joachim Lankenau (hjs@openoffice.org)
Don't search INCLUDEDIRS if the filename to be included starts at fs-root.

2001/05/29 Patrick Luby (pluby@openoffice.org)
Added forceful exit to avoid infinite loop that sometimes occurs when
there is a fatal error. Lost a child problem. (Part I)

Version 4.2
===========
(Note, the dmake -V output was not changed and still said
"Version 4.10, PL 0". This probably should have been 4.1)

2001/04/20 Martin Hollmichel (mh@openoffice.org)
First autoconfiscation of dmake.

2001/02/13 Hans-Joachim Lankenau (hjs@openoffice.org)

Implement boolean expression "or".
