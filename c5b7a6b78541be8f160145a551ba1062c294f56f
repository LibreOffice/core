      "message": "So - reading this again; surely we just want the inverse of all the aGrid.AddVerLine and AddHorLine that we would render into the range ? Isn\u0027t this all in the ScOuputData already ? perhaps it\u0027s similar to GetMergeOrigin ? not sure, but ... new loops like that scare me ;-) what information is missing that we need to collect more before rendering \u003d)",

      "message": "To draw the cover lines we need to know what is the background color of the merge area. But the background color of a merge area is only available on the top left cell of that merge area. The tile area where we paint need not have the top left cell of the merge area, so that is why we need to extend the search to find the top left cell. This information is not needed for painting normal grid lines.\n\nBut now I\u0027ve another idea now to paint the cover lines always using sheet background color *before* we paint the background, so that we don\u0027t need to know the bgcolor of the merge area, hence we can avoid the search for it. I\u0027ll test and upload that patch soon.",
