      "message": "I find this very bizarre. Linux fails (and probably everything else fails) with this assert, but not Mac. I could always switch to the \"Mac\" version of the equation, but should something else be done?  SwCharFormat certainly looks like the \"correct\" thing to be checking for. (And there is an include charfmt.hxx...).\n\nThis feels like a compiler / optimizer bug to me. Should I be asking someone to investigate? Or just document that this is a compiler workaround for an unknown issue and proceed?",

      "message": "macOS (and anything using LLVM\u0027s libc++abi, for that matter) is using the original Itanium ABI rules when comparing RTTI (strictly by pointer, not by name).  This requires a single instance of the RTTI of SwCharFormat to be visible across the involved libraries (Library_msword here, presumably together with Library_sw), by marking SwCharFormat (sw/inc/charfmt.hxx) as SAL_DLLPUBLIC_RTTI.  (That class might also benefit from a key function at which to anchor vtable and RTTI emission, i.e., a non-inline dtor, but that\u0027s somewhat orthogonal.  Exporting weak RTTI symbols from the libraries should suffice.)\n\n(The heuristics in loplugin:dyncastvisibility did not catch this; for them to work, SwCharFormat would need to be declared in a global include/sw/ file, and Library_msword would need to move to its own top-level module.)\n\n(That said, basing the bConvertToShading decision on dynamic_cast here may or may not be considered too brittle.)",
