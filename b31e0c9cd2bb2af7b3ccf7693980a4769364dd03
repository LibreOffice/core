      "message": "FYI: I created it that way because I only have gdb-headless package on my system and that\u0027s sufficient for use inside of vscode.\n\nWith gdb installed, it works without having the miDebuggerPath sepcified, so the linux configuration block is not unnecessary/the defaults work for me. So if the default of /usr/bin/gdb also is what you expect it to pick up it can be removed, If the intent is to allow custom GDB from different PATH/not from your distro, then keep the more verbose variant",

      "message": "I suppose that having it explicitly mentioned here is better for a novice who may see it in the config, and simply change to their liking, instead of having to find out the proper setting name. Of course, removing it completely is not a problem, but e.g. in your case of using a different path, wouldn\u0027t this be more convenient - just add your path?",
