      "message": "Hi Mike! I need your advice on this problem. Imho, the fix for this problem is correct since Win encodes new lines using \\r\\n and Unix systems with \\n. However, if I make this change, the rtf line breaks (SHIFT+ENTER) disappear since they are also encoded using \\n on Unix systems (DomainMapper::lcl_text) and so I am not able to distinguish them (DomainMapper_Impl::HandleLineBreak). Is there any other character to insert a SHIFT+ENTER line break on Unix systems?",
