      "message": "I wonder if changes like this make the code any more readable?\n\nI guess in general some iterations are adequately written as a traditional (non-range) for loop with an index variable that is only used to count the number of iterations, and does not happen to be used for anything else in the loop body.  I guess that loplugin:unusedindex is too blunt a tool in general, and I fear that blindly \"fixing\" all its findings makes the code worse, not better.",
