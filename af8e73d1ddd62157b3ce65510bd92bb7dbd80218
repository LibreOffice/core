It is specific to some binary representation of numbers in a given system.\n\nHowever, *iif* this artifact really ascends to that, then we don\u0027t need it. In IEEE 754, both 32-bit (float) and 34-bit (double) representations of 30.6 are slightly *greater* than 30.6 (use https://baseconvert.com/ieee-754-floating-point to check). Just use the correct value, and have some unit tests just in case.",
