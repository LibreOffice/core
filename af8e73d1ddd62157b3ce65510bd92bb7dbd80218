It is specific to some binary representation of numbers in a given system.\n\nHowever, *iif* this artifact really ascends to that, then we don\u0027t need it. In IEEE 754, both 32-bit (float) and 34-bit (double) representations of 30.6 are slightly *greater* than 30.6 (use https://baseconvert.com/ieee-754-floating-point to check). Just use the correct value, and have some unit tests just in case.",

However, the old value is 30.6001 and the new value would be ~30.60000038 so I agree we should have a unit test of some Hijri calendar values *before* this change (years 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 for example) and see how that changes with the new value and if then compare with some official reference (if there is any..).",
