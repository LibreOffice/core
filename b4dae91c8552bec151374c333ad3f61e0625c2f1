      "message": "Your solution works now. Nice to see how you have solved tricky parts on your own.\n\nOnly a few cosmetics:\nWe do not change whole, old files to clang-format. But new added parts should be in clang-format. In your code do not use double empty lines but only single empty line (#1207, #1221), and change \u0027if ( foo )\u0027 to \u0027if (foo)\u0027 (#1191).\nYou can consider to move the angle calculation to inside \u0027if (xPropSet.is()){}\u0027.\nYou can consider to omit fX and fY and use the values from aScale directly in the condition.\nThe two CPPUNIT_ASSERT_MESSAGE are useless in that place, because in case there is no xShapeProps it will break before in \u0027xShapeProps-\u003e\u0027. You can simple delete them.\n",
