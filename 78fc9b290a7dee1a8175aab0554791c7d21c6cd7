The TabDialog() ctor expects a const OUString\u0026, the only thing that changed is that now (unnecessarily) a temporary copy is passed.\n\nI also don\u0027t see where a cast to non-const and a change of the object would occur. TabDialog() -\u003e Dialog() -\u003e loadUI() -\u003e VclBuilder() all pass/use const OUString\u0026",
