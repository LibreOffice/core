      "message": "Is cloning that actually necessary? Apparently InsertEntryForItem() is called from InsertEntryForSourceTarget() above, where pOriginalItemValue is a pointer to an instance already managed elsewhere. So unless that is destructed before this ScPivotLayoutTreeList instance, simply inserting the pointer should do. But maybe I\u0027m missing something?",
