      "message": "* if all that is changed (as is the case in this file) is the variable\u0027s name (and which is a modification that is orthogonal to the change\u0027s goal as stated in the commit message): just don\u0027t  (and uniformity across a module is something that is likely not achieved anyway, or at least doesn\u0027t last long)\n\n* when you need to introduce a new variable name, my advice is to omit any variable decorations that don\u0027t actually help, like the fake-Hungarian encoding of the variable\u0027s type in the name (\"b\" for bool, \"s\" for OUString, \"p\" for pointer, \"r\" for reference, \"x\" for css::uno::Reference\u003c\u003e, \"a\" for other class-types, and whatever nonsense more got invented; see the discussion of what\u0027s called \"Systems Hungarian notation\" at \u003chttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation\u003e; my use of \"fake\" alludes to how people misunderstood the original(?) intend to use it to encode semantic information, and unhelpfully used it to encode type information instead), or an \"s_\" prefix for a local static (of short scope); on the other hand, what may be useful is to distinguish class member variables (e.g., by \"m_\" prefix or \"_\" suffix)\n\n* when you come across an existing variable name, just don\u0027t bother and leave it as it is (unless the name\u0027s decoration makes it grossly confusing now after your change, in which case better drop the decoration)\n\nBut beware, some people may be strongly attached to that fake Hungarian decoration circus.  :)",
