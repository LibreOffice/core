      "message": "I might misunderstand the problem here, so excuse me if I write nonsense. IIUC, the problem when you can\u0027t simply \"save\" a format is when the filter used to import is import-only. It likely isn\u0027t related to \"native\", as in various formats like OOXML that are also not native. So possibly it could help to make the pdf import format to be import+export (so reducing special-casing)? Of course, the old import and export filter names should still work (redirect to the new import+export filter?), because they are used very intensively in user scripts...",
