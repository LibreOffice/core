This directory contains test files for the UNO Runtime Environment (URE) as well
as the Makefile and Makefile.pln makefiles.  To execute the makefiles, you need
GNU make 3.80 or later.


Makefile
--------

Before you execute Makefile, you need to configure the Software Development Kit
(SDK) environment to work with a URE installation, a C++ compiler, and a JDK.
For more information, read the .../docs/install.html file in the SDK
installation.

NOTE: On Linux x86, if the Makefile accesses a GCC that is incompatible with the
GCC that was used to build the URE, use the GCCS_COMPAT environment variable as
a workaround.  For more details, see the UDK README file.


Makefile.pln
------------

You can only run Makefile.pln on Linux x86.  You do not need to configure your
SDK environment to use this makefile, however, you do need to set the following
environment variables:

- SDK_HOME
Points to the base directory of an OpenOffice.org SDK so that you can access UNO
programming tools and files that are not part of the URE.  For example, idlc,
cppumaker, javamaker, UNOIDL files, and C++ headers.

- PATH
Points to a GCC installation (including g++) as well as a JDK installation that
contains the java, javac, and jar executables.  For the minimum version
requirements, see the SDK Installation Guide ($SDK_HOME/docs/install.html).

- URE_HOME (optional)
Overwrites the default URE location, that is, /opt/openoffice.org/ure.

- GXX_INCLUDE_PATH (optional)
Overwrites the default location of the GCC C++ headers (/usr/include/g++).  This
information is needed by the STLport included in the URE.

- GCCS_COMPAT (optional)
Fixes incompatibility issues between the GCC that was used to build the URE and
the GCC that Makefile.pln accesses.  For more details, see the UDK README file.


Tests
-----

Makefile and Makefile.pln can execute the following tests:

- test-cpptest
Builds a C++ UNO component, cppmain.uno, and runs the component with the uno
executable.  The component first attempts to instantiate all the UNO services
and singletons that are part of the URE installation.  The component then tries
to instantiate and to call another C++ UNO component (ccptest.uno) as well as a
Java UNO component (javatest.uno).  The test completes when these components
throw a special exception that is caught by cppmain.uno.

- test-javatest
Builds a Java UNO component, javamain.uno, and runs the component with the uno
executable.  The component tries to instantiate and to call a C++ UNO component
(cpptest.uno) as well as a Java UNO component (javatest.uno).  The test
completes when these components throw a special exception that is caught by
javamain.uno.

- test-javanative
Builds a Java UNO application, javanative.jar, and runs the application with the
java executable.  The application bootstraps a native UNO environment, and then
tries to instantiate and to call a C++ UNO component (cpptest.uno) as well as a
Java UNO component( javatest.uno).  The test completes when these components
throw a special exception that is caught by javanative.jar.

- test-clientserver
Builds a server C++ UNO component, cppserver.uno, and a Java UNO application,
javaclient.uno.  The uno executable runs the cppserver.uno component which
listens on a pipe connection.  The java executable runs the javaclient.uno
component which connects to the server after a five second pause so that the
server has enough time to start.

- test-regview (Makefile.pln only)
Checks that the regview executable of the URE installation works reliably.

NOTE: The files that are generated when Makefile and Makefile.pln execute are
saved to different local directories.  Makefile outputs the generated files to
./out.sdk whereas Makefile.pln outputs the files to ./out.pln.
