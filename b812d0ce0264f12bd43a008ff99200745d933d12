      "message": "Alt+P and Shift+Alt+P work but Alt+C not unless I remove these uno:UnicodeNotationToggle lines. Although my locale is EN_US, and Alt+X does toggle the unicode. \n\nJustin/Samuel/Miklos made the changes for bug 73691 (with a lot roundabouts to make the actual Alt+X work across OS and locales). The request was not unanimously accepted and I strongly believe that precious shortcuts must not be used for such a nerd feature. My take: revert and use it for P/Pg/C-Style.\n",
