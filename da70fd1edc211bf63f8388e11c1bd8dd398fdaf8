      "message": "(-: It was intentional.  Here is the story behind it:  I do not have glade, so I just compare the gtk3 code -- and this one property was different from the same implementation for Levels in the numberingpositionpage.ui  - plus I could not see that these property was listed for GtkTreeView (in the gtk3 manual) - so thought it best to delete -- in case it was also contributing to the problem.",
