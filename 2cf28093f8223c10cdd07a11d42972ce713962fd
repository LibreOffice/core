These are not delivered to $(OUTDIR)/inc, but rather to $(INSTDIR)/sdk/include (and used by the build from there), and they must continue to be delivered, because they are part of SDK. I think we should move them too and then deliver all of them to $(INSTDIR) from ure.\n\nBut that can be done as an additional step.",
