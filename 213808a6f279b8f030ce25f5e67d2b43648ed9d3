      "message": "I came across this with a tentative new loplugin that flags comparisons between signed and unsigned types where the unsigned one is explicitly cast to signed (which often indicates that this is a poor way to silence a \"signed vs. unsigned\" compiler warning, potentially causing silent, non-UB overflow, and that a better solution could be available).  That plugin turns out to have a high signal/noise ratio, though, so what I\u0027m doing here is submitting the obviously \"signal\" findings for now, while postponing the decision how to go forward in light of the high rate of \"noise\" findings.\n\nSo if this change should be considered detrimental (though is there a good way to actually measure that?), we can of course abandon it at least for now.  (In which case it would be good to document why mnListenersFirstUnsorted deliberately has a semantically inappropriate type, though.)",
