      "message": "This \"-1\" made it so that buttons area\u0027 top border coincided with listbox bottom border, creating an impression of a combined control.\n\nNow the two borders (bottom one of button area, and top of listbox) are separate, which looks like double-width border, separating the areas visually.\n\nThe buttons area top border now is exactly in the position where listbox top border was - so that\u0027s fine; but listbox bottom border is one pixel lower than previously bottom border of buttons was - which means we need to bump listbox position 1 up - e.g. by adding \"-1\" to lines 1005 and 1011 - see the comment there",
