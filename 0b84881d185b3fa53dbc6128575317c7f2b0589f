      "message": "The maximum value is not fixed for a parallelogram in OOXML, but depends on width and height. Here maximum is 100000 * width / (min(width, height)). I have identified a lot of such pattern. You can find them in /svx/source/customshapes/EnhancedCustomShape2d.cxx. The methods there are for calculating the adjustment value from the handle position in UI, so not directly usable here. But the identified pattern might help you to find the correct conversion here.",

      "message": "Well, what i saw in the OOXML standard there were only that information, what \"these values are input parameters for equations, and they do not have unit\" but i did not find any reference for the range for these. I did not saw the equations so in the case of the triangle i checked carefully how this parameter affects the shape with modifying the xml. Then i find the maximum and minimum values for it. (by setting the floater on the UI to the end positions). In the case of the parallelogram i just checked the range only. So thank you for the help, and the information where i can find it. That cxx if i know well serves import functionality, but it is good for revealing these values for conversion.\nNext patch soon with the fix for the mentioned problems.",
