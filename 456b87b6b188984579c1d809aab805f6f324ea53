      "message": "\u003e This policy is new for me.\n\nLooks like we never spelled out that policy too explicitly (discussion at that time centred more around tooling to ensure clang-format\u0027ing of new files than around the rationale why not to reformat existing code).  The closest I come up with with an ad-hoc search now is my \u003chttps://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2017-November/078785.html\u003e \"Re: minutes of ESC call ...\", which then became part of the deal of introducing clang-format:\n\n\u003e To maybe clarify that a bit:  I see no value at all in enforcing any \n\u003e formatting as an end in itself.  I only see it as a means to drop the \n\u003e future amount of reformatting commits to zero.  (What I mean with \n\u003e \"reformatting commits\" is both commits that do no changes other than \n\u003e reformatting source code, as well as commits that mix---related, or even \n\u003e unrelated---reformatting of source code with some \"real\" changes. \n\u003e Either form creates \"noise\" that makes it harder to inspect individual \n\u003e git commits and the git history.)",

      "message": "Guess I should have expressed myself a bit more verbose. I\u0027m aware we don\u0027t want to reformat the code in generally. Looking at the diff, I can now see, that the removal of the large chunks of code + the minimal reformat, made the diff harder to follow. Originally I just did the patch, did the c-f of the final source, found the diff acceptable small and squashed the patches, instead of keeping them separate.\n\nI still find it a sensible goal to have a common formatting for most of the code. I would even prefer, if the infrastructure could enforce the formatting on all new code, but that seems hard to implement. And it would annoy people even more then the compiler plugins for non-clang-based development, as it would make submitting \"Gerrit passing\" patches even harder (I doubt there is a sensible way to clang-format a patch only).",
