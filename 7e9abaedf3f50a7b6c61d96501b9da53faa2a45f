      "message": "\u003e Is Qt glyph positioning being wrong something introduced by this patch?\n\nNo. That is a known problem of the QFont based SalLayout. I also missed the fact, that bVertical is actually a property of the font and not a parameter to rotate the font.\n\n\u003e Actually, no, I didn’t test rotated text and was merely\n \u003e relying on the tests since they failed badly last time I touched\n \u003e bounding rectangles. But I’ll test once I get back to that machine.\n\nFWIW - for QFont the vertical ruler in Writer is currently empty (if you start  LO with SAL_USE_VCLPLUGIN\u003dqt5). The QPainter based drawing in LO is experimental, so that\u0027s not a problem. But I was wondering, how to fix it, and didn\u0027t understand what was going on. Your patch explains a potential problem, I had missed.",
