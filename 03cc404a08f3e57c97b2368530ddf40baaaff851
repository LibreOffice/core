Unit tests breakage, because the comparison against GRFMGR_AUTOSWAPSTREAM_TEMP was failing, even though it was previously assigned to this value.\n\n\u003e on other 64-bit platforms, the resulting SvStream* values will be 0x00000000FFFFFFF* (whether or not that\u0027s a good idea)\n\nWe should clean up this mess in the first place.\n\n\u003e so it looks odd that on Windows 64-bit only they should be 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF* instead\n\nI managed only to get it work, after turning to signed, so that GRFMGR_AUTOSWAPSTREAM_TEMP \u003d\u003d -2.",
