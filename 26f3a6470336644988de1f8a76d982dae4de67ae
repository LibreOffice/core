      "message": "The view container is looped over twice. Once calling clearAll for each view. However, if you look at SlideRenderer clearAll is also called there, so I\u0027m not sure why the first loop is there. Is there a reason why it is called twice? I removed SlideRenderer and moved the contents of the () operator to the body of the for loop.",
