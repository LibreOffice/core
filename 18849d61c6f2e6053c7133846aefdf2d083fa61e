Would this help to remove that?\n\nI\u0027ll give this change a try with my clang-cl build, but I suspect that I globally set -Wno-missing-braces there (in line with what we do for Clang and GCC on non-Windows) because it caused hard-to-fix or otherwise annoying warnings beyond what is addressed by this change.  (In which case doing this change, and hunting down the loplugin:redundantfcast, might be kind of moot.)",
