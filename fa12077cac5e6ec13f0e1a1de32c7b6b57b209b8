      "message": "A pool range in this context is the \"which id\" range of the pool, I think. Each sfx item has a which id, the Writer-specific ones are in sw/inc/hintids.hxx. Like RES_CHRATR_WEIGHT -\u003e character bold, RES_CHRATR_POSTURE -\u003e character italic and so on. An sfx item set can contain these sfx items, but the item set has to have a range (or multiple ranges): it can only contain sfx items, whose which id is inside those ranges.\n\nI guess the situation is the same for an sfx item pool: the item pool can provide default items and again has to have a which id range.\n\nSee SfxPoolItem, SfxItemSet and SfxItemPool.",
