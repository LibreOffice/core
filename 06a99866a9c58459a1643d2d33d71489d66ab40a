      "message": "I assume that you moved this section from sc/source/core/tool/stylehelper.cxx here just to be able to use SC_STYLE_PROG_STANDARD in ScOrcusStyles::cell_style::cell_style, right?\n\nTwo issues caused by this change.\n\n1. It would be *very* desirable to limit the change to the minimum. In current state, sc/source/core/tool/stylehelper.cxx and two functions in sc/source/filter/orcus/interface.cxx (ScOrcusStyles::cell_style::cell_style and ScOrcusStyles::set_cell_style_parent_name) could be kept unchanged at all, and sc/inc/stylehelper.hxx changes could be limited to DLLPUBLIC bits.\n2. If you move the strings here, I\u0027d suggest you to change them from #defines to constexpr OUStringLiterals. The lines are new here anyway, so the refactor would be nice (but I\u0027d still suggest do the refactor in a separate commit, dedicated to improving code structure, where you would also replace the hardcoded string in ScOrcusStyles::cell_style::cell_style with the constant).",
