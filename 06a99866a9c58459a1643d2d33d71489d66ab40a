      "message": "I assume that you moved this section from sc/source/core/tool/stylehelper.cxx here just to be able to use SC_STYLE_PROG_STANDARD in ScOrcusStyles::cell_style::cell_style, right?\n\nTwo issues caused by this change.\n\n1. It would be *very* desirable to limit the change to the minimum. In current state, sc/source/core/tool/stylehelper.cxx and two functions in sc/source/filter/orcus/interface.cxx (ScOrcusStyles::cell_style::cell_style and ScOrcusStyles::set_cell_style_parent_name) could be kept unchanged at all, and sc/inc/stylehelper.hxx changes could be limited to DLLPUBLIC bits.\n2. If you move the strings here, I\u0027d suggest you to change them from #defines to constexpr OUStringLiterals. The lines are new here anyway, so the refactor would be nice (but I\u0027d still suggest do the refactor in a separate commit, dedicated to improving code structure, where you would also replace the hardcoded string in ScOrcusStyles::cell_style::cell_style with the constant).",

      "message": "I moved these defines from stylehelper.cxx to stylehelper.hxx because I want to use SC_STYLE_PROG_STANDARD in ScOrcusStyles::cell_style::cell_style. I moved all of them because they are a code block with the same functionality, and I thought it makes no sense to separate them in two different files, and it is very likely that those defines would be used somewhere else.\n\nI changed them from constexpr OUStringLiterals to #defines because I get \"defined but not used\" compiling -Werror message if I use constexprs, as this header file is used in multiple cxx files in our code base.\n\nIf you think it would be better to limit the move to the SC_STYLE_PROG_STANDARD, then I\u0027ll do it.",
