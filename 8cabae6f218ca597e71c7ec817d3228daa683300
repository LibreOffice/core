Is this the way to handle this - or should vcl/unx/gtk3/gtkinst.cxx sooner return the switched page as the current page? Messing with extensions is certainly safer...",

In the prior patch I said \"gtk3 needs an additional fix so it doesn\u0027t follow the second-last-used-tab instead.\"\n\nPrior to this patch, reloading the document would save the second-last-used tab from the form control properties. With this patch it will properly save the last-used-tab.",

      "message": "Probably safest to go this route. I guess there\u0027s a bit of a lacuna as to when each toolkit thinks the page has been fully switched to. The extensions \"property browser\" is one of the most complicated things there is in our UI, only the data browser set of things (by the same original author) is as tricky, both often relying on vcl quirks nothing else or noone else is aware of.",
