      "message": "So - lets drop the atk whitespace change. Before we do anything here - we -must- not touch the a11y APIs unless this is explicitly enabled since they can have significant memory and performance impacts for users that don\u0027t want that.\n\nThen - we badly don\u0027t want to instrument the a11y code to add LOK callbacks to it.\n\nInstead in the desktop/source/lib/init.cxx - I would expect: when a view is enabled for a11y - to register listeners with vcl and inside those connect via the UNO API to our a11y functionality and listen to that in various UNO listener objects we would create in desktop/source/lib. Those listeners should emit LOK events - and be built on top of the generic a11y code.\n\nI am not expecting to need any changes to core LibreOffice a11y here - just a \u0027bridge\u0027 from UNO-a11y to LOK-events.\n\nThanks!",
