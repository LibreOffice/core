  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">Software License Agreement (v angleščini)</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">The use of the software by the end-user is bound entirely by the following terms. If you install this software, you agree to abide by the terms set out in this contract. If you do not agree to this contract, return all data storage media and any written material to the place from which you obtained it, for a full refund.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">The object of the contract is the computer program stored on the data storage medium and all printed material supplied together with this, such as Operating Instructions. The object of the contract will be referred to below as Software. As it is not technically possible at present to produce software that functions without error under all circumstances, the object of the contract is Software which functions in the way as described in the Operating Instructions.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">The purchase of this Software entitles the licensee to the ownership of the data storage medium but not to rights to the software itself. All rights concerning the software remain the property of <text:s/>&lt;field:company&gt;, especially but not exclusively the publication, copying, editing and exploitation rights. <text:s/>&lt;field:company&gt; <text:s/>issues the licensee with the right to a simple (not exclusive) and personal right to use the software for an unlimited period of time. This right of use is referred to below as license.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">The licensee may install the software on a single workstation. Installation on additional workstations (e.g. laptops) is only permissible if it is guaranteed that at no time more than one installation is in use. Any other uses, especially installation in a network is not allowed. The licensee may make one copy of the software product for backup or archival purposes.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">You may pass on this Software to a third party only under the condition that they agree to all rights and obligations pertaining to this license. The licensee must, in this case, hand over the entire software and immediately destroy all installations and copies in his ownership.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">The software is protected by copyright in favor of &lt;field:company&gt;, Inc.. Copyrights and registration numbers must not be removed from the software nor from any backup copies that may have been created. It is explicitly forbidden to copy in any way whatsoever the computer program or the printed material in full or in part, in its original form or in a modified form. This also includes the integration of the software into other software or packaging of different software.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">The licensee may not</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">&lt;UL&gt;modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software,</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">&lt;UL&gt;translate, modify or copy the printed material,</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">&lt;UL&gt;create derivatives of the software or printed material.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">If the licensee violates any of the conditions of this agreement they forfeit the right of use. If this occurs they must destroy the original software as well as all installations and backups or hand over such to &lt;field:company&gt; if requested to do so. The licensee is liable to <text:s/>&lt;field:company&gt; for all costs and damages resulting from contractual violations.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">&lt;field:company&gt; retains the right to update existing software when appropriate or to produce new or improved versions. If requested, the licensee can obtain a new or updated version from <text:s/>&lt;field:company&gt; for a set fee.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">&lt;field:company&gt; warrants that the data storage medium is free from material defects. If the data storage medium is faulty it will be exchanged upon presentation of the invoice or receipt and return of the original data storage medium. If a defect is not removed within an appropriate period, the licensee can cancel the contract or claim a refund. An appropriate period is at least two months. The licensee can also cancel the contract if the software cannot be used in accordance with §1 of this agreement.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">&lt;field:company&gt; is not liable if the software does not meet with the requirements nor serve the purposes of the licensee nor if it does not work with other programs and hardware components selected by the licensee.</text:p>
  <text:p text:style-name="Standard">&lt;field:company&gt; shall not be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or any other pecuniary loss) unless proven to have to been caused by the negligence of &lt;field:company&gt;.</text:p>
