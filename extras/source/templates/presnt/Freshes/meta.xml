               Freshes - LibreOffice Impress Template
                        by Risyad Rais

Freshes Template is supposed to be a template for LibreOffice
Impress. But I guess calling it a placeholder or sample slides might be even
more suitable since it's not really optimized properly for LibreOffice Impress
Workflow.
This template is made as an answer to Indonesian LibreOffice Community and
Gimpscape ID's call-to-arms to contribute to the 10th anniversary of
LibreOffice celebration.
##How to
###Normal slides
1. Duplicate the slide you want to edit
2. Edit the texts
3. Rearrange the slides and remove the ones you don't need
###Icons
To change icons, go to: &quot;Insert -> Special Character&quot;
and choose the one you like.
###Chart slides
1. Double click the chart
2. Edit Data Table
##Features
1. A fresh looking first and last slide with huge typography
2. Covered single bullet to four bullets slides
3. Charts available in two styles: Collumns and Lines
4. A very mediocre looking Diagram and Table slide
5. Timeline slides
6. Super simple Closing slide
