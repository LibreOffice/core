Turns out we tried copying the string (by accident), but that didn\u0027t work, see commit e2b9946022c2a286ebac625ccb45f5ddddd5a5d6.\n\nThe spaghetti code in this function needs to have a BIG WARNING COMMENT to avoid accessing rTxt after ChgAutoCorrWord has returned \"true\" once, because it\u0027s not at all obvious.",
