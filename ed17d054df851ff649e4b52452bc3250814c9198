      "message": "1. Please read the Bugzilla page carefully, specially comment 6 and 7:\nhttps://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d146150#c6\n\n2. You are changing many modules simultaneously. You have touched 3 different examples in which one is Windows-specific, extensions, framework, and qadevOOo modules (https://docs.libreoffice.org/). Some the changed files are in Java, and others are in C++.\nOn the other hand, I prefer that you touch them one by one, so that it would be possible to test if your changes work properly.\nCould you please start from odk/examples/DevelopersGuide? You can go to instdir/sdk/examples/DevelopersGuide/OfficeDev to build and test the example, but first you have to go to use ./instdir/sdk/setsdkenv_unix to setup environment variables.\nThe ContextMenuInterceptor example could be a good starting point. Run it after \u0027make\u0027 in this way:\n\n    make ContextMenuInterceptor.run\n\nIt is listed here:\nhttps://api.libreoffice.org/examples/DevelopersGuide/examples.html#OfficeDevelopment\nAnd described here:\nhttps://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/WritingUNO/Intercepting_Context_Menus",
