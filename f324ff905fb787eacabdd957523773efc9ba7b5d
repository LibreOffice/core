      "message": "Adding a new UNO interface is always a cost. Did you consider if there is a cheaper alternative? One idea: get the list of all pages styles in writerfilter/ at the start of the import (getElementNames() can give that to you) and then given that only the DOCX import inserts new styles, you could have the findUnusedPageStyleNameStartingWith() code to writerfilter/.\n\nWould that work? If it\u0027s as good as the current code, then that would be better, as it would not require a new UNO interface.",
