      "message": "Is this first LockView required? Seems to be the cause of the Navigate By control not scrolling to the annotation window when used from the sidebar Navigator panel or from a toolbar. Scroll happens when used from the floating Navigator. When this line is removed it works from all places. Please see bug report at https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d146191. I have suggested a work around patch to scroll to comment anchor instead of comment edit window but may be better to make it work like it previously did.",
