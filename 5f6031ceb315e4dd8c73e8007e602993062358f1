      "message": "I would guess that 1 and 24 are the most likely values.\n24 for most of our stuff and 1 for mask layers.\n\nAlso this function is only used in two places, so if it shows up on a performance profile, it would be a good candidate for moving it to the header file (i.e. inlining)\n\nI seem to remember there is a bug/feature somewhere about creating and using a SAL_LIKELY macro(tdf#39631). Perhaps this would be a good use-case?",
