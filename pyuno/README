UNO bindings for the Python programming language.

To have much joy debugging python extensions you need to:
  a) edit pythonloader.py in your install setting DEBUG=1 at the top
  b) touch pyuno/source/module/pyuno_runtime.cxx and 'make debug=true' in pyuno

Then you'll start to see your exceptions on the console instead of them getting
lost at the UNO interface.

Python also comes with a gdb script
libpython$(PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR).$(PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR)m.so-gdb.py
that is copied to instdir and will be auto-loaded by gdb;
it provides commands like "py-bt" to get a python-level backtrace,
and "py-print" to print python variables.

Another way to debug python code is to use pdb: edit some initalization
function to insert "import pdb; pdb.set_trace()" (somewhere so that it is
executed early), then run soffice from a terminal and a command-line python
debugger will appear where you can set python-level breakpoints.
