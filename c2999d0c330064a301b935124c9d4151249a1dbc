This is a problem also in 7.3 then (I assume) and needs a fix in 7.3 too. But the string freeze for 7.3 has passed so backporting this fix would add strings to 7.3 :-(\n\nDo we get the desired results if we instead just change the CuiResId at cui/source/tabpages/border.cxx:1377 to SvxResId ? If that was enough then that alternative change could be easily backported to 7.3 without affecting the string freeze.",
