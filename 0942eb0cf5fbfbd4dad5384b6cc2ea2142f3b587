      "message": "This looks like using two different techniques to get the same goal. One is using temporary profile to avoid changes to actual user profile; the other is to prevent actual writes to (part of) used profile. I suppose that in fact having a real \"read-only\" mode (without modifying any profile parts) could be useful - but then using temp profile would become unnecessary. Or - find a place which makes registrymodifications file have hardened permissions not allowing to clean the profile, and fix that.",

This change e.g. will enable installing shared extensions while user (with admin rights) has LibreOffice already running (because the spawhed instance will use a different user profile); but making it non-Windows will make this aspect different across platforms.",
