    * handle reopened documents
    * modified argument list of custom dashed penstyle
    * fix warning messages at maximum recursion depth and memory

    * modified turtle colors
    * fix showturtle
    * fix LineStyle_SOLID and LineStyle_DASHED
    * add repcount to the infinite loop
    * add logical expression and better list support to the simple LibreLogo expression parser
    * add string size limit for Print()
    * support "pic" without block: new shape
    * use localized __string__ for STR instead of str
    * add min, max, and regex functions: sub, search, findall
    * fix double round in localizations
    * more stable dotted lines in the PDF export (implemented as arrays of dot-headed arrows)
    * circles with dotted lines
    * working pos and pagesize indices in expressions

2012-05-17 László Németh:
    * fix opt. suffix syntax of for+in (eg. with Finnish :ssa, Hungarian -ban)
    * add dashed outline of turtle to show "pen up" state
    * fix initial turtle focus for OpenOffice.org and older LibreOffice versions
    * parsing simple (with 0 or 1 argument) user functions in complex expressions
    * add localized "global"
    * add localized operator "in" for logical expressions
    * parsing user functions with 2 or more arguments in simple numerical expressions
    * function heading supports coordinates
    * function position supports drawing
    * function pensize supports argument any
    * set SizeProtect feature of turtle shape
    * replace random while repcount variable with iterator
    * fix repcount checking in conditions of "while" loops
    * add repcount support to "for x in y" loops
    * fix OUTPUT and STOP for lines with multiple commands
    * fix = -> == conversion in logical expressions in OUTPUT
    * fix multiple document support using CreationDate instead of Title
    * better OpenOffice.org 3.2 compatibility (optional usage of feature Visible)

2012-05-08 László Németh:
    * picture [] handles left hanging shapes better
    * function random works on lists or list-convertable objects (string, tuple, dict, set), too
    * faster "label" (remove unnecessary shape search)
    * document-level turtle states
    * clean name spaces
    * localization of "pi" (localizations support greek letter pi as alternative)
    * localized "float"
    * int & float support localized decimal signs and measurements (float '10,5cm')
    * print, label, text support localized decimal sign

2012-05-02 László Németh:
    * fix slow drawing of new line shapes (unnecessary shape search)
    * "circle" and "square" are synonyms of ellipse and rectangle, eg.
      square num = rectangle [num, num]

2012-04-27 László Németh:
    * Initial release
