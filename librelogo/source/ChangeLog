      document (UI fix for the missing feedback)
    * LOG10 function
    * PENTRANSPARENCY, FILLTRANSPARENCY: set transparency of the actual color:

      - FILLTRANSPARENCY 20 ; 20% transparency of the areas
    * fill gradient support
      - FILLCOLOR ['red', 'blue'] ; gradient between red and blue
      - FILLCOLOR [[255, 255, 255], [255, 128, 0]] ; between white and orange
      - FILLCOLOR ['red', 'blue', 0, 90, 20] ; linear, 90deg gradient with 20% border
      - FILLCOLOR ['red', 'blue', 0, 90, 20, 0, 0, 200, 50] ; from 200% to 50% intensity
      - FILLCOLOR ['red', 'blue', 2, 0, 0, 50, 50] ; radial, with 50-50% x, y (centre)
    * transparency gradient support (similar settings, without intensity values)
      - FILLTRANSPARENCY [75] ; linear gradient from 75% to 0% transparency
      - FILLTRANSPARENCY [75, 25] ; linear gradient from 75% to 25% transparency
