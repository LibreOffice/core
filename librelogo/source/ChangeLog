    * fix SVG cropping in LibreOffice 4.1
    * fix vertical positions of labels in SVG export using RectangleShape
    * fix double stroke-width attributes in SVG export
    * LABEL supports relative positioning vector [X, Y, 'text'], where X, Y
      0: center, eg. as the default positioning: LABEL [0, 0, 'text']
      1: left or bottom aligned to the turtle position and angle
     -1: right or top aligned to the turtle position and angle
      n: n * text_width/2 or text_height/2
    * simple SVG SMIL (animation) support using SLEEP, for example:
      PICTURE 'animation.svg' [ CIRCLE 5 SLEEP 1000 CIRCLE 20 ]
    * relative FORWARD (heading = y axis) with vector arg.: FORWARD [20, 10]
    * rounded linejoint of turtle shape

2013-07-15 László Németh:
    * optional named PICTURE blocks: PICTURE 'name' [ CIRCLE 5 ]
    * save PICTURE as cropped SVG file using path names, for example:
      PICTURE 'example.svg' [ CIRCLE 5 CIRCLE 20 ] ; save in the home directory
      PICTURE '/home/user/example.svg' [ CIRCLE 10 ] ; absolute path (on Linux)
      PICTURE 'tmp/example.svg' [ CIRCLE 10 ] ; relative to the home directory

    * clockwise HEADING

2013-04-30 László Németh
    * fix hide/show turtle

2013-02-24 László Németh:
    * fix Asian and CTL language support. Language recognition depends from the
      UI language of LibreOffice and the language(s) of the document.
    * fix turtle shape, the problem with the old arrow-like turtle shape
      reported by teachers and other users of turtle graphics
    * better consistency with the UI based position and rotation settings of the
      turtle: now Drawing Object toolbar supports also the pen color, fill
      color and transparency, also line width settings of the turtle.
    * real dotted line works with rectangles, also with rounded corners
    * restore original cursor position and selection at the end of the running
      (problem reported by Viktória Lakó)
    * fix 'sleep' (resulted by the new default non-integer division of Python 3,
      reported by Prof. Gilvan Vilarim)

      Prof. Gilvan Vilarim)
    * fix false leading and ending function name recognition
    * support 'translation' of the selected text
    * fix bad line width settings after command 'home'
    * fix dot shape of dotted lines (remove its 0 width 'tail') by minimal dot
      size of dotted lines: 1pt, and shorter 'tail' size
    * fix size of the rounded corners of the rectangle shape
    * rotation doesn't modify the size of the selection frame of the turtle

2012-12-26 László Németh:
    * fix turtle position and rotation at repeated hideturtle/showturtle
    * add new languages, fix Czech and Brazilian Portuguese for
      language guessing at translation

    * trace loading problems (with PYUNO_LOGLEVEL environmental variable)

2012-11-24 László Németh:
    * zero turtle width in hideturtle mode to draw at the left border of the page

2012-11-06 László Németh:
    * uppercase/translation icon:
    - expands and uppercase Logo commands (fd -> FORWARD)
    - translation between supported languages (commands, decimal sign, for/in order)
    * new icon for clear screen
    * add English manual (see LibreLogo/Logo/Turtle graphics in Help)

2012-10-25 László Németh:

    * handle reopened documents
    * modified argument list of custom dashed penstyle
    * fix warning messages at maximum recursion depth and memory

    * circles with dotted lines
    * working pos and pagesize indices in expressions

    * function pensize supports argument any
    * set SizeProtect feature of turtle shape
    * replace random while repcount variable with iterator
    * fix repcount checking in conditions of "while" loops
    * add repcount support to "for x in y" loops
    * fix OUTPUT and STOP for lines with multiple commands
    * fix = -> == conversion in logical expressions in OUTPUT
    * fix multiple document support using CreationDate instead of Title
    * better OpenOffice.org 3.2 compatibility (optional usage of feature Visible)

2012-05-08 László Németh:
    * picture [] handles left hanging shapes better
    * function random works on lists or list-convertible objects (string, tuple, dict, set), too
    * faster "label" (remove unnecessary shape search)
    * document-level turtle states
    * clean name spaces
    * localization of "pi" (localizations support greek letter pi as alternative)
    * localized "float"
    * int & float support localized decimal signs and measurements (float '10,5cm')
    * print, label, text support localized decimal sign

2012-05-02 László Németh:
    * fix slow drawing of new line shapes (unnecessary shape search)
    * "circle" and "square" are synonyms of ellipse and rectangle, eg.
      square num = rectangle [num, num]

2012-04-27 László Németh:
    * Initial release
