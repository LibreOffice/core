2012-02-24 László Németh:
    * fix Asian and CTL language support. Language recognition depends from the
      UI language of LibreOffice and the language(s) of the document.
    * fix turtle shape, the problem with the old arrow-like turtle shape
      reported by teachers and other users of turtle graphics
    * better consistency with the UI based position and rotation settings of the
      turtle: now Drawing Object toolbar supports also the pen color, fill
      color and transparency, also line width settings of the turtle.
    * real dotted line works with rectangles, also with rounded corners
    * restore original cursor position and selection at the end of the running
      (problem reported by Viktória Lakó)
    * fix 'sleep' (resulted by the new default non-integer division of Python 3,
      reported by Prof. Gilvan Vilarim)
    * fix 1-character length variable name/casing problem (reported by
      Prof. Gilvan Vilarim)
    * fix false leading and ending function name recognition
    * support 'translation' of the selected text
    * fix bad line width settings after command 'home'
    * fix dot shape of dotted lines (remove its 0 width 'tail') by minimal dot
      size of dotted lines: 1pt, and shorter 'tail' size
    * fix size of the rounded corners of the rectangle shape
    * rotation doesn't modify the size of the selection frame of the turtle

2012-12-26 László Németh:
    * fix turtle position and rotation at repeated hideturtle/showturtle
    * add new languages, fix Czech and Brazilian Portuguese for
      language guessing at translation
    * fix line break to paragraph break conversion at translation 

2012-12-17 László Németh:
    * handle possible translation problems (strip terminating bars)
    * keep double compilation of the commands
    * trace loading problems (with PYUNO_LOGLEVEL environmental variable)

2012-11-24 László Németh:
    * zero turtle width in hideturtle mode to draw at the left border of the page

2012-11-06 László Németh:
    * uppercase/translation icon:
    - expands and uppercase Logo commands (fd -> FORWARD)
    - translation between supported languages (commands, decimal sign, for/in order)
    * new icon for clear screen
    * add English manual (see LibreLogo/Logo/Turtle graphics in Help)

2012-10-25 László Németh:
    * fix positioning to the faulty program line
    * program cache depends from the (modified) language of the document, too

2012-10-21 László Németh:
    * speed up command line
    * add multiline tooltip to the command line (it works well from LibO 3.6.2)
    * random color constants: ~color, eg. '~orange', '~green' etc.
    * handle modulo operator
    * ask before the compilation of long documents (avoid freezings)
    * add compilation cache to the multiline programs
    * better help window caption in the command line

2012-06-27 László Németh:
    * fix __string__ (use localized decimal sign)
    * fix repcount in loops with inner picture block
    * handle reopened documents
    * modified argument list of custom dashed penstyle
    * fix warning messages at maximum recursion depth and memory
    * add hatching styles (fillstyle num or
      fillstyle [line count(max 3), color, distance, degree]
    * add localized set(), range(), sorted() 
    * fix turtle selection at program start
    * modified turtle colors
    * fix showturtle
    * fix LineStyle_SOLID and LineStyle_DASHED
    * add repcount to the infinite loop
    * add logical expression and better list support to the simple LibreLogo expression parser
    * add string size limit for Print()
    * support "pic" without block: new shape
    * use localized __string__ for STR instead of str
    * add min, max, and regex functions: sub, search, findall
    * fix double round in localizations
    * more stable dotted lines in the PDF export (implemented as arrays of dot-headed arrows)
    * circles with dotted lines
    * working pos and pagesize indices in expressions

2012-05-17 László Németh:
    * fix opt. suffix syntax of for+in (eg. with Finnish :ssa, Hungarian -ban)
    * add dashed outline of turtle to show "pen up" state
    * fix initial turtle focus for OpenOffice.org and older LibreOffice versions
    * parsing simple (with 0 or 1 argument) user functions in complex expressions
    * add localized "global"
    * add localized operator "in" for logical expressions
    * parsing user functions with 2 or more arguments in simple numerical expressions
    * function heading supports coordinates
    * function position supports drawing
    * function pensize supports argument any
    * set SizeProtect feature of turtle shape
    * replace random while repcount variable with iterator
    * fix repcount checking in conditions of "while" loops
    * add repcount support to "for x in y" loops
    * fix OUTPUT and STOP for lines with multiple commands
    * fix = -> == conversion in logical expressions in OUTPUT
    * fix multiple document support using CreationDate instead of Title
    * better OpenOffice.org 3.2 compatibility (optional usage of feature Visible)

2012-05-08 László Németh:
    * picture [] handles left hanging shapes better
    * function random works on lists or list-convertable objects (string, tuple, dict, set), too
    * faster "label" (remove unnecessary shape search)
    * document-level turtle states
    * clean name spaces
    * localization of "pi" (localizations support greek letter pi as alternative)
    * localized "float"
    * int & float support localized decimal signs and measurements (float '10,5cm')
    * print, label, text support localized decimal sign

2012-05-02 László Németh:
    * fix slow drawing of new line shapes (unnecessary shape search)
    * "circle" and "square" are synonyms of ellipse and rectangle, eg.
      square num = rectangle [num, num]

2012-04-27 László Németh:
    * Initial release
