If so, it\u0027s misconception - e.g., res/lx03126.png is for BMP_CALC_LC, and latter is mapped to SvImageId::Calc - i.e., \"generic Calc icon\" (i.e., not a specialized variant available specifically for its native file, ODS).",

But I stopped digging after found that one, because that was the point that mage it clear that these specific icons that we are talking about in this gerrit change are used for both MS- and non-MS filetypes.\n\nAs I mentioned in response to Adolfo, I can see a benefit of recognizing MS filetypes - but that is, again, unrelated to the problem we discuss: *if* there appears an enhancement request to differentiate, and *if* it\u0027s accepted, then it must be implemented by adding *new* icons, and the accompanying *new* code to use those new icons in selected cases; while *these* icons must stay generic.\n\nPlease let us focus on a specific problem; it feels like we are slowly drift away, and start discussing unrelated stuff :-)",
