      "message": "@Tibi: thanks for checking! \n\nWhat is the incoming value of sURL in the Hungarian build? The localized STR_SLIDE_NAME \"Dia\" or something similar?\n\nI believe, that failing test is a symptom that we need to replace sSlide with a localized string, that would be the real solution for this problem (bad slide numbers can occur with the localized LibreOffice, too).\n\nI\u0027ve checked sd/qa/unit/data/pptx/tdf144918.pptx in a localized 7.3, but the second link (jump to the Third page) is still broken. Could you check that, too?\n\nIf that is still broken with your fix, I suggest e.g. to extend oox/inc/ooxresid.hxx with STR_SLIDE_NAME, and replace sString with OoxResId(STR_SLIDE_NAME) instead of this workaround  (or if we could use STR_SLIDE_NAME from sd e.g by moving that to svx and because it seems, svx strings are accessible in oox: \n\noox/source/ppt/pptimport.cxx:        aWarning +\u003d \":\\n\" + SvxResId(RID_SVXSTR_WARN_MISSING_SMARTART);\n).",
