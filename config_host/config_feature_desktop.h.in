/* DESKTOP - Whether we have a "normal" desktop UI or not.
 *
 * Non-DESKTOP in practice means touch-based mobile devices, Android
 * or iOS for now. Support for those is work in progress.
 *
 * Non-DESKTOP implies that the OS makes sure that only one instance
 * of each LibreOffice-based "app" at a time can be running, and thus
 * the LibreOffice code does not need to handle such things itself.
 *
 * Non-DESKTOP implies no traditional inter-app drag and drop concept.
 *
 * Non-DESKTOP implies no traditional help mechanism, and to some
 * extent (as noticed, and as possible without making the code too
 * ugly) the related code is ifdeffed out.
 *
 * Non-DESKTOP implies no traditional desktop-style GUI elements like
 * toolbars and scrollbars presented by the LO code.
