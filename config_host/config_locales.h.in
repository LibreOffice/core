/* Configuration of restriction on supported locales, by the
 * --with-locales option.
 *
 * (Note that this is totally unrelated to what UI language(s) were
 * configured with the --with-lang option.)
 *
 * Normally, especially for desktop OSes, LibreOffice is built to
 * support all the locales and character encodings that it has code
 * (data) for in the source code. By using the --with-locales
 * configure switch, this can be restricted.
 *
 * This file defines feature test macros for those languages for which
 * at least one locale is to be supported. In some cases, a feature
 * test macro for a script is provided in addition or instead.
 *
 * Only languages for which there exists separate code and/or data in
 * the source code need to be mentioned here.
