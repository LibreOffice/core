#ifndef CONFIG_SKIA_H
#define CONFIG_SKIA_H

// This is a setting that should be set manually and it affects LO
// code rather than Skia itself. It basically controls setting
// BackendCapabilities::mbSupportsBitmap32, i.e. whether one LO bitmap
// contains all the 32bits of an image including the alpha (premultiplied).
//
// Since Skia does not natively support 24bpp, the preferred setup is
// that the setting should be enabled, it makes the code faster and cleaner.
//
// Unfortunately VCL historically splits alpha into a whole separate
// bitmap and works with 24bpp+8bpp, which is generally more complicated,
// more error-prone and just worse, but that's how LO code has been
// written and so there are many places in LO that expect this and
// do not work correctly with true 32bpp bitmaps.
//
// So ultimately the 24+8 split should be dumped (preferably in all of LO,
// not just the Skia-related code), but until all of LO works correctly
// with 32bpp keep this disabled in order to avoid such breakages.
