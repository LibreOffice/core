# Generating Custom Shape Presets

The Perl code (`generatePresetsData.pl` and `generatePresetsPPTXs.pl`) is used
to generate the custom shape presets.

The `generate.sh` script which invokes the above Perl files, should be invoked
from the libreoffice core top-level source folder:
```
oox/source/drawingml/customshapes/generate.sh
```
The logs will be created in the file:
```
oox/source/drawingml/customshapes/custom-shapes.log
```
 
The output would be placed in this folder:
```
oox/source/drawingml/customshapes/pptx/
```
