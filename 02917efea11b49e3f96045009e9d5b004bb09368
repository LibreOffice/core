(no idea how to change code to handle that, honestly speaking)\n\nIt seems unnecessary to check this at each iteration of the for() loop - this check may be done once before the loop? I assume m_pCurrFrame wouldn\u0027t change in the function, so creating SwRectFnSet could be also done once (or am I wrong?)",
