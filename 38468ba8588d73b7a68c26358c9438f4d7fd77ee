      "message": "These decimal tests look odd in the \"testHexOctal\". I now think we might had misunderstood esch other, if you asked me if we need additional test *for the decimals* (this detail was missing in the question), and I took that as asking if we need additional test for *octals* (which I happened to think about at that time).\n\nWell, I hoped that there is a similar test dedicated to *decimals* that could be amended just like you do here with hex/octals with type characters. If so, I would not add a new test, but extend existing decimals-oriented test. If not, I\u0027d introduce a \"testDecimal\" near the \"testHexOctal\", and put the decimals there, to keep distinction.",
