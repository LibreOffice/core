      "message": "Is there a reasonably simple way to detect how many non-trivial destructors are called from a destructor? The thing is that a destructor with an empty body is not necessarily trivial, it may expand into quite a lot of code if the object needs destructing a lot of members, and in some of those cases it might be better to not remove/inline those.\n",
