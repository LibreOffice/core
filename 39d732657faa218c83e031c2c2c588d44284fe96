      "message": "Hey Seth, Thanks for the comment!\n\nPatchset 2 corrects order placement of fields in headers/footers and frames. Previous to this patchset these are always placed first in the list. (This is due to doc model nodes structure header/footer and frames nodes being placed in a special section before the regular doc nodes section.) Hyperlinks in frames, headers/footers currently display this first in members list behavior. The getContentNode function, used in the fields stable sort, can be used to correct this behavior in the hyperlinks list after the patch is merged.",

      "message": "This also sounds good (because my templates use fields for dates, pages, etc.) and Navigator has not always been so elegant in that connection.\n\nAnd one small comment about \"sorting\" -- \n\nI mention it in case it is relevant for you -- otherwise please ignore -- because I may have misunderstood the commit message.  \n\nIf I insert Statistics fields, with number formatting, then they appear alphabetically in Navigator, independently of their order in the document (i.e.):\nStatistics - Characters - 23\nStatistics - Pages - 1\nStatistics - Words - 3\n\nBut if those fields were formatted with \"A B C\", then they also appear in Navigator according to document order.",
