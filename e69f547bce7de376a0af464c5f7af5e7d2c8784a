      "message": "This line makes sure that Flush is only called for windows. Removing it makes calls to Flush for other devices, too; this has two results:\n\n1. A virtual function is called for other devices (some overhead);\n2. If some non-Window class will override Flush, it will be executed.\n\nI don\u0027t know if any of these points are important - just mentioning it here. Possibly it\u0027s even incorrect to avoid the calls for other devices.\n\nOf course, with the current implementation (when Window::Flush is not marked final) the cast on the next line is useless in any case.",
