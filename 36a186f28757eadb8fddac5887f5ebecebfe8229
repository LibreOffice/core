      "message": "The test file is unfortunate because it already contains a line feed \u0026#x0a; at the 16368th position, so no further line splitting takes place when editing the content. Manually executing the test in an unfixed version also passes.\n\nRemoving the \u0026#x0a; yields usable content. Note however that (for yet unknown reason) pasting into the Input Line adds a blank before the line break, which it doesn\u0027t when pasting in-cell after F2. So this test is fragile in case that gets fixed..\n",
