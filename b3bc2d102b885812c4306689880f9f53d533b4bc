      "message": "I think, that it is the wrong place to fix it. There is the method lcl_IsOnAllowlist() which has all LO preset shapes where it is known, that no suitable preset exists in OOXML. That method could be used in the condition where DMLPresetShapeExporter is called.\n\nThere is a related problem with shape \"heart\". OOXML has a shape with name \"heart\", but that has a different outline. Therefore \"heart\" is on \u0027Allowlist\u0027 too. If you save a \"heart\" to DOCX and reopen it, then you get a different looking shape. When saving to PPTX, you get a same looking shape because for PPTX DMLPresetShapeExporter is not used. ",

      "message": "Thanks for the advice, i have replaced the previous modification for this function. You are absolutely right, if there are more shape-types what will have problems  with the preset because they are not exist in ooxml that is a mutch better solution for checking. Hopefully this will be fine :)",
