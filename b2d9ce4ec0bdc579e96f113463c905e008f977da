Please do not forget clang-format your patches before submitting! Thanks.",

      "message": "Running TestInvoke, you in fact test some nested invocation: first you use the invoke here, and then you call in from Basic (in TestInvoke).\n\nIt might be enough to make TestInvoke the only one function in the document, which would directly assign a float to its byRef param, and test that param here. But generally, no objection as is :-)",
