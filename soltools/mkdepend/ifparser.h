 * Simple if statement processor
 *
 * This module can be used to evaluate string representations of C language
 * if constructs.  It accepts the following grammar:
 *
 *     EXPRESSION   :=  VALUE
 *           |  VALUE  BINOP    EXPRESSION
 *
 *     VALUE        :=  '('  EXPRESSION  ')'
 *           |  '!'  VALUE
 *           |  '-'  VALUE
 *           |  'defined'  '('  variable  ')'
 *           |  variable
 *           |  number
 *
 *     BINOP        :=  '*' |  '/'  |  '%'
 *           |  '+' |  '-'
 *           |  '<<'    |  '>>'
 *           |  '<' |  '>'  |  '<='  |  '>='
 *           |  '=='    |  '!='
 *           |  '&' |  '|'
 *           |  '&&'    |  '||'
 *
 * The normal C order of precidence is supported.
