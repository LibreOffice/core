      "message": "You need to be careful with this change... Make sure you are not introducing a circular reference somewhere not-so-obvious...  Also, why use rtl::Reference instead of something like std::shared_ptr?  With the latter, you could also use std::weak_ptr in places where it makes sense.\n\nAlso, you are removing forward declarations in lots n lots of places. I personally think that\u0027s a bad build hygiene though I know many of you don\u0027t care about build times these days... (I do, but whatever).\n\nBeyond that, I can\u0027t really offer any better approach.  But I feel like this change is way bigger than it needs to be...  Isn\u0027t there a simpler approach to this?",
