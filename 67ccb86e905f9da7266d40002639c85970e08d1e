The intention of the grab-bag is to just preserve some information we can\u0027t handle, without influencing any of the layout or UI code.\n\nIf you have to access this information in the grab-bag, then probably the doc model has to be extended. But then I understand that we already have two pool items for char background and char shading? So I\u0027m a bit confused here. :-)",
