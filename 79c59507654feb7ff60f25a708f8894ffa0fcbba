      "message": "Some of these definitions are not even used right now in the .cxx file, but they seem to be useful.\nFor example, consider \"LeapYear\". It is possible to define a method for checking if some year is a leap year or not, but it is not currently used. Do you think defining this method now and using it later would be good?",
