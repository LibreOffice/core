      "message": "That\u0027s a good question that actually Miklos already asked in the ML.  My best answer is there as well: https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2022-June/089108.html\n\nBottom line is: I get a couple extra failures if I remove the override altogether, although I can\u0027t actually make much sense out of them. There is `CppunitTest_sw_ooxmlexport2/testCustomProperties`, and `CppunitTest_sw_uiwriter4/testTableRemoveHasTextChangesOnly` (that second one makes more sense at least looking at the name, though that one crashes, not simply fails).  I got CppunitTest_sw_layoutwriter2 to act up a bit as well, although I have it crashing in both situations, just not in the exact same way.\n\nIf you think it\u0027s a better idea to get those tests to pass without the override we can try that, but I\u0027m not sure I have all the required skill to do so properly myself (e.g. I while I probably could fix the ooxmlexport2 test looking at the results I do get, I wouldn\u0027t know what I actually was doing).",
