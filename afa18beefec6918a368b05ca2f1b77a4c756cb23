      "message": "Yes, that was intentional, but now I forget why.\n\nI started with all three, but then after a bit of research I dropped the one (in master patchset 3). [Too bad I missed this comment earlier or else I might have remembered better.]\n\nI think it was because I could only find evidence that those two were-being/could-be tampered with. I don\u0027t think I removed it because I could see it causing a specific potential problem.\n\nMostly, I\u0027m not super clear of all the implications of what removing those fonts might entail, to so I wanted to minimize the damage.",
