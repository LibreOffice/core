      "message": "if this is showing up in a perf-profile, then changing it to use o3tl::sorted_vector instead of std::vector will make the std::find O(1) instead of O(n).\n\nAt the cost of potentially changing the order in which listeners are currently being called, and of increasing the insert/delete cost, but normally event listeners are called several orders of magnitude more often than the list is modified. \n\nAnd if that is really is a problem, we could pull the logic out of SfxBroadcaster into a standalone class, because that amortizes insert/delete cost.",
