      "message": "I was a bit paranoid here, thinking that Qt may return a null device ratio, crashing LO when used as a divisor. If we assume this never happens, I\u0027d remove this, otherwise I\u0027d probably set 1 as the ratio and we should do this everywhere. What do you think?",

I actually tried to use the QWindow::devicePxelRatio, but somehow that reported 1 for me - see my other comment.",
