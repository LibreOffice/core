But it is correct in the sidebar, which does the rounding a bit differently.\n- Also the fixed line spacing field rounds the max value differently, so the max is 55.9 instead of 56 like for above/below spacing.\n- In the sidebar the fixed line spacing box has no max limit set, unlike for the above/below spacing boxes.",
