      "message": "In a feature branch I was trying to create a drawinglayercore separate library still inside drawinglayer component (like svxcore and svx), which can be freely used inside vcl [1], because it doesn\u0027t depend on it. This looks similar to what you try to do, without the need to put it into vcl. I don\u0027t like we have to put them inside vcl, but I would rather have the core of drawinglayer, that isn\u0027t dependent on any backend or existing implementation as an independent component.  \n\n[1] https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?h\u003dfeature/drawinglayercore2\u0026id\u003d41a6764a029f2a22d93c52dc83826ea3eed10eaa",

I\u0027ll check it up and prepare the patch.\n\n\u003e My personal opininion is that drawinglayer is so tied into graphics we should just move all of it into vcl.\n\u003e \n\u003e This patch is (from my perspective) a compromise solution.\n\nIt is true that drawinglayer is tied to graphics in vcl, but ideally the core implementation and interfaces should be independent. There are other dependency loops - for example vcl \u003c-\u003e svgio (probably emfio too), which are patched-around in vcl with UNO. If the drawinglayer core and interfaces are nicely abstracted then there wouldn\u0027t be such no problem as svgio doesn\u0027t need anything vcl specific (ideally, now it needs at least BitmapEx and co).",
