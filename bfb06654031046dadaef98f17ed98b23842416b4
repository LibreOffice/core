      "message": "In a feature branch I was trying to create a drawinglayercore separate library still inside drawinglayer component (like svxcore and svx), which can be freely used inside vcl [1], because it doesn\u0027t depend on it. This looks similar to what you try to do, without the need to put it into vcl. I don\u0027t like we have to put them inside vcl, but I would rather have the core of drawinglayer, that isn\u0027t dependent on any backend or existing implementation as an independent component.  \n\n[1] https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?h\u003dfeature/drawinglayercore2\u0026id\u003d41a6764a029f2a22d93c52dc83826ea3eed10eaa",
