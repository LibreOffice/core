      "message": "In my test examples, I didn\u0027t see an SvNumFormatType::LOGICAL assigned to non-bool formula\u0027s (like \u003dsum(100)), even when I set the cell formatting to boolean. Thus the cell format was logical, but the numFormatType was still NUMBER. So I couldn\u0027t create an example document to prove the necessity of this. But it certainly can\u0027t hurt to do this, compared to the state where we were before.\n\nAs a cleaner alternative, I could see just writing the mfValue regardless, and setting\nrsType \u003d LOGICAL ? \"b\" : \"n\";\n\nActually, I rather strongly prefer to do it this way, and I don\u0027t see any downsides.\n",
