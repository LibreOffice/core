      "message": "If the following call to FillAnalyse will assign a value to eDateCmd if it sets eFillCmd to FILL_DATE, then there is no good reason to initialize eDateCmd to a random value here, as eDateCmd is actually read below only if eFillCmd is FILL_DATE.  (And leaving eDateCmd uninitialized here has the advantage that tools like Valgrind can detect violations of the assumption that FillAnalyse will assign a value to eDateCmd if it sets eFillCmd to FILL_DATE.)",
