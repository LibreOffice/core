      "message": "I see this is done in the DOCX filter, but as a first step, I think we want to ignore this setting. The setting is about \"lock down the smartart: convert the group shape to an un-editable metafile + preserve smart-art markup\". We only want the \"preserve the smart-art markup\" half of this behavior change in PPTX. If you do this, that\u0027ll fix the test failures as well.\n\nAnd then in a separate change, we may want to enable the \"smart art to shapes\" setting by default, and then we can put this check back.\n\nSo the point is: make sure \"keep diagram compat info\" only means \"keep the DOMs in the shape interop grab-bag\", not \"covert group shape to metafile\", as that later part is not wanted.",
