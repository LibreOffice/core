This change makes a user-visible behavior change; it needs some justification, in form of a bug report/enhancement request which describes its need, possibly with the UX discussion. (Besides its technical problems; the latter need a use of Unicode character classes, presumably ICU).\n\u003e \n\u003e For example, there is a tdf#91130 and UX team proposal bout font listing https://design.blog.documentfoundation.org/2018/02/18/improvements-font-listing/\n\u003e \n\u003e I think would be really better for all people just realize that proposal\n\nSo it seems tdf#114764 will be a related issue for this commit I think. :-)",
