To aid understanding, I use the following subtle scheme:  If a comment precedes the commented code, make it into a sentence (starting with an uppercase letter) ending with a colon.  If a comment follows the commented code, indent it one level further than the code and make it into only part of a sentence (don\u0027t start it with an uppercase letter, except of course in cases like \"OK\" here).",
