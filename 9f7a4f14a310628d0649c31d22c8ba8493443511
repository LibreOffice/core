Using sal_uInt64 here looks funny (although technically correct): as if we actually require that out theme count be no less than what only fits to 64 bits :-) compared to, e.g., 32 bits that we use to count textual data length (in OUString) ;-)\n\nUsing `auto` or `size_t` would make the size of variable an implementation detail.",
