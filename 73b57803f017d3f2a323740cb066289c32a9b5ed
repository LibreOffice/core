      "message": "@Caolan: Thanks for having an eye on it. I thought to solve that by not holding that helper class longer than needed. Also the DiagramDataPtr in that Diagram class also hosts a ShapePtr to the same shape, so maybe mpShape can be avoided completely - have to check this after having reached a form that serves the needed purposes - it\u0027s somewhat in progress.\nFor now just push it I guess. Thanks again!",
