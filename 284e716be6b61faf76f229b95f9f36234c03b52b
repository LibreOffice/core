      "message": "My understanding is that the definition of hairline line style is that it is drawn exactly as 1px wide, at a given pixel position. If you want something else, you need to use a normal polygon with a line width in logic units, not a hairline. But if it turns out I\u0027m wrong, we can restrict this behavior for the cases when we don\u0027t scale the display, not a problem (context is headless rendering, as mentioned in the commit msg).",
