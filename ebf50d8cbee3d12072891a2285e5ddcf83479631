Is it necessary to run it twice?\n\n[Now that I think more about it, it probably IS necessary to run twice, because the run was probably cleared at the paragraph end, and thus only the char-style applies to the paragraph. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t understand from the documentation what NOFORMATATTR actually does. Perhaps a comment here indicating what running this again actually accomplishes would be good.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve found, that missing call of insertTextPortion() with its NOFORMATATTR is the key here. Now I documented it:\n\n+        // tdf#127616 apply character style based formatting of empty paragraphs\n+        // if the formatting contains also direct character formatting,\n+        // using NOFORMATATTR as in insertTextPortion(), which isn\u0027t called\n+        // in empty paragraphs.\n\nIndeed, there is no documentation about NOFORMATATTR, but this is which used for runs, so I only adapted to the corner case, without knowing exactly, what is there in the background. :( By the way, this is only half of the solution, so I will continue on changing the format of the paragraph marker, too, to solve the potential page layout difference. :)\n\nThanks for your review!",
