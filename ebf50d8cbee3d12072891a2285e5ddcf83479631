Is it necessary to run it twice?\n\n[Now that I think more about it, it probably IS necessary to run twice, because the run was probably cleared at the paragraph end, and thus only the char-style applies to the paragraph. Unfortunately, I can\u0027t understand from the documentation what NOFORMATATTR actually does. Perhaps a comment here indicating what running this again actually accomplishes would be good.",
