// The whole purpose of this test is to check that public API headers
// build even without RTL_USING (which enables using e.g. rtl::OUString
// without to refer to the rtl namespace, which is not wanted
// in public API). If there are build errors here, check the headers
// for uses of such types.

#ifdef RTL_USING
#error Build system problem, RTL_USING using should not be set here.
#endif

// This module contains no tests, this is for the build system.
