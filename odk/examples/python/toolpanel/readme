This extension is a Proof of concept on implementing Toolpanel in Python

- make will create the oxt
    - provided sdk environment is set
    - alternatively zip the files and name it toolpanel.oxt
- install it
- activate Task Panes in menu (check View > Task Pane menu)
- enjoy!

The events of the controls (Click me button) in the task panel are handled by basic macro code to illustrate that Toolpanel definition and events codes are independent. One could use any language to react on events

Then focus only on .py and xml files for the toolpanel activation analysis
