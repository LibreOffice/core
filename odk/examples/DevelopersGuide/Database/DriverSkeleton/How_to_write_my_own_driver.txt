How to write my own sdbc driver

Pre implementation steps
- search all occurrences of skeleton and replace them to a name which you prefer

1. Implement a class called driver or modify the existing skeleton	-> have a look at SDriver.?xx
2. Implement a class called connection					-> have a look at SConnection.?xx
3. Have a look at the DatabaseMetaData					-> see SDatabaseMetaData.cxx
	The methods which should be implemented at least are
		- getTableTypes
		- getTables
		- getTypeInfo
		- getColumns

4. You need a statement to show/access some data				-> have a look at SStatement.cxx
										-> especially executeQuery()

5. The ResultSet: without you see nothing					-> look at SResultSet.cxx
6. The ResultSetMetaData needed to get some information about what are waiting for us
										-> look at SResultSetMetaData.cxx

7. The prepared statement is the last class we have to implement now
	-> you have to allow statements like "SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = ?"

8. congratulations you have now implement your own driver :-)
