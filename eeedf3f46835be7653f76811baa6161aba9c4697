      "message": "Looks good, do you think you could cover the fix with a test?\n\nIf you start soffice with SW_DEBUG\u003d1, then you can create an xml dump of the layout when you press F12, a layout.xml in the current directory. If you can create a layout dump before/after your fix, then you can compare the dumps and see how they differ. If you see a meaningful difference there (e.g. a text portion has a different horizontal position or something like that), then that would be straightforward to test from e.g. sw/qa/core/text/text.cxx. See for example testLineHeight in that file.",
