      "message": "I HAVE to check the table properties first - because some WIDs are in both paragraphs AND tables.  Since this is primarily a table, it needs to have priority. I wrestled with whether to move this entire section AFTER the table implementation code, but that would have meant another \"git blame\" entry / extra indentation.\n\nSo, based on that logic, your suggestion about the \"throw exception\" makes more consistent sense than my implementation. I\u0027ll make that change.",

      "message": "I have questions about this.  If there WAS not SwAttrSet, then GetSwAttrSet() will create a basic one. However, the result of GetItemState is NOT DEFAULT as I would expect, but it is SET??? (e.g. for ParaLineSpacing and ParaBottomMargin). And yet, if an earlier item creates the itemset (like BottomBorder) then the result comes back as DEFAULT.",

      "message": "SfxItemSet::GetItemState() returns SfxItemState::UNKNOWN by default. Then if the which id is in one of the which id ranges of the set, then it\u0027s DEFAULT, finally if the item set actually has a pool item for that which id, then it\u0027s SET. (svl/README has some documentation around these item sets and pool items.)\n\nThe which id ranges of a set is fixed at construction time, an item set ~always takes an item pool (for \"pooled items\", i.e. defaults) and a set of which id ranges in its constructor.\n\nI hope this answers your question. :-)",
