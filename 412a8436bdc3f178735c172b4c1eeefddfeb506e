But, if it\u0027s not the correct method, should I change it to join().",

You need to call join after you call GenericDialogController::run(); I tried this and it worked fine.\n\nHowever, there are issues because you have to hold a SolarMutex (with SolarMutexGuard) everytime you work with VirtualDevice and other UI calls, which is a pain and I didn\u0027t manage to get it working, so let\u0027s forget this for now. \n\nI like the introduction of m_aTestVector, so can you change this patch, which just introduces that...",
