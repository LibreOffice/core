      "message": "one problem: this is NOT at all targeted to the specific case the bug report is describing. This is any time a table cell is modified. So the scope is HUGE. But I\u0027m not sure that changes anything. If the user has non-number content and forces a number format on it, that generally ought to be ignored. \n\nTyping text into an explicitly number format cell also removes that formatting with ClearBoxNumAttrs().\n\nThere are a number of places in ndtbl (since original import) with\n        // Just resetting Attributes is not enough\n        // Make sure that the Text is formatted accordingly\nI\u0027m pretty sure that is because ModifyWatcher calls this BoxAttributeChanged function - and thus ChgNumToText() is called. Following that, RES_BOXATR_FORMAT is reset. Since the old format was already textFormat, it is sufficient to just reset it here.\n        ",
