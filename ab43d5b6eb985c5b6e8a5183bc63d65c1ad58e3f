Thanks.\n\nAll 3 changes are just meant to expose the various PDF export parameters we already made public to extensions to be also accessible via the LOK API / cmdline convert-to. Once these are in, we could update https://www.collaboraoffice.com/document-conversion/ to advertise this tiny feature.\n\nSee https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/commit/4d6ca688f98d217866b9ea49113a356134dfba3a for the online side.\n\n(Originally I just did this for myself to help debugging a partial export bug, but it\u0027s a nice win for end-users as well, it seems to me.)",
