      "message": "Oh! Here goes some misunderstanding.\n\nWhen talking about the rename, I only meant one variable inside CellValueGetter::visitNode method, which was initially called eType, and which was unrelated to the ValueType, it didn\u0027t relate to the result of Range::value or Range::value2. It was holding the type of the data in a cell, and thus *unrelated* to your change.\n\nYou decided to rename it for some reason; I assumed it was because the eType was confusing, and one could make a mistake, thinking that eType relates to ValueType. But the rename was from eType to eValueType, and that was even more misleading.\n\nTo clean up the confusion, I suggest now to do this:\n\n1. Revert the last changes to the Patchset 6 (i.e., undo what you done last).\n2. Open CellValueGetter::visitNode, and *inside it* (only!), rename eValueType to eType.\n\nThat would make the patch perfect. Thank you, and excuse me for being unclear - English is not my first language :)",
