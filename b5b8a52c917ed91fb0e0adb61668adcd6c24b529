I believe your change is benign and doesn\u0027t change the logic, so I\u0027m fine with it.  But it would be nice to know what GCC was unhappy about...",

Unfortunately, GCC is notorious for producing increasingly hard-to-comprehend warnings at increasing -O levels (with what at least feels like increasing rates of false positives).  If I ever find the time and energy, I\u0027ll try to generate a stripped-down reproducer and present it to the GCC folks.",
