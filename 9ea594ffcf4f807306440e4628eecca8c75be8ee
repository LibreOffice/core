      "message": "\u003e This should not include nIntValue 9.  That means \"body level\" in DOCX. There is no equivalent in LO\n\nThe bugdoc just has 1 and 2, so a more strict upper limit is fine. (Style1, Style2 and Style3 has ilvl\u003d0, 1 and 2.) I don\u0027t have a sample with ilvl\u003d9, is that something you have?\n\n\u003e This suggests that LO needs to change their internal levels from 0-9 into 1-10 (same as OutlineLevel) and leave 0 for no/cancelled level.\n\nMy understanding is that NumberingLevel\u003d0 already means \"no numbering\" in the direct formatting case, so reusing that in the style case is OK. Or did I miss something? Perhaps I do, you spent a lot of time on numberings just recently. :-)",
