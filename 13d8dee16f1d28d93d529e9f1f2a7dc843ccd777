The original context strings were not that good to begin with; for example they should follow the convention and use prefix like \"qrdialog|extended_tip|\" for extended tooltips.  Since I\u0027m making these changes in a text editor instead of in Glade, and I don\u0027t have a environment to build and test changes, I\u0027d rather make them minimal.",
