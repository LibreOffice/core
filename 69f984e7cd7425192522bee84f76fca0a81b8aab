      "message": "I\u0027m surprised to see this here. I imagine that the UNO nonsense behind this officecfg:: thing is hideously expensive. Can we try to avoid that ? I would prefer to use something like:\n\nsc/source/core/tool/calcconfig.cxx:    static comphelper::ConfigurationListenerProperty\u003cbool\u003e gOpenCLEnabled(getMiscListener(), \"UseOpenCL\");\n\nFor this - whereby we can call a simple function that fetches a simple static global here - presumably wrapped up in CalcConfig.\n\nAlso - in general, I\u0027d like to move the logic as to whether we actually thread / do CL stuff - into the interpret section - and not have it here - so, the boolean should mean: \"Can theoretically thread this\" - and the decision as to whether to do that is taken later based on weight, settings \u0026 so on.\n\nThanks ! \u003d)",
