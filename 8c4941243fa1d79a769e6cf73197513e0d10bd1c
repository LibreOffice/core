      "message": "These three unit tests (includingTablePosition14/15) failed when I added _start/_end support, which is how I found this second bug.\n\n_start/_end support is NOT needed to fix this bug. In the XRay tool, LeftBorderDistance\u003d\u003d0, but in the unit test LeftBorderDistance\u003d\u003d106. I failed to figure out how that is even possible.  Adding _start/_end support(needed for the other bug anyway) makes the unit test run properly, so both fixes are combined into this one commit.",
