      "message": "Hi Michael,\n\nActually I don\u0027t know what went wrong. m_bIsNewDoc is always true so it was inserting empty value. I dont know the purpose of m_bIsNewDoc. I think if footer note start node has value then we should update appendstack with actual value. It was causing exception at popfieldcontext. While debugging I found this was the root cause so made changes here.\n\nThanks.",
