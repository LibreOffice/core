However, with gtk3 I get the wrong font name for Western (Alef / lang \u003d Germany) and if only one of the two non-Western is enabled I get the third in an extra \"column\" at the dialog.",

The font name in the entry+list doesn\u0027t quite look fully right yet, but maybe a little better. I might be able to have another look at that later.",
