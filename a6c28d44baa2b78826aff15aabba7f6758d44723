      "message": "This makes the #else clause to be executed e.g. on macOS and Linux (including 64-bit). While currently harmless (since their texts don\u0027t have \"%BITNESS\"), this is logically inconsistent; the #else is only supposed to be executed in 32-bit Windows code.\n\nThe pre-existing logic was not optimal from this PoV. It created a dialog with a string still not preprocessed, then extracted that string back, processed, and set dialog\u0027s text again.\n\nHere you keep the logic. I suppose it would be better to move creation of the dialog from all branches, to a place after all string pre-processing already has been performed. So that you declare and initialize OUString with the argument to SvtResId conditional on platform; then you make necessary preprocessing (partially also conditional on platform); and then you have a single dialog creation line taking the final text.\n\nAdditionally, this is a no-op now, since replaceAll does not make its changes in-place, but rather returns a copy with changes",
