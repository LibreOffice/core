The shadow transparency should be multiplied by the transparency of the fill.\n\nE.g., here is a sample with transparency 0 from the bugdoc, with borders removed:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/hmYl8ni\n\nThe cell background is 80% transparent. Powerpoint gives the shadow taking care of that, *and* blurs that.",
