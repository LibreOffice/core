    * gstplayer.cxx (processSyncMessage): remember GstXOverlay
    (processMessage): explicit expose when we reach paused state -
    this mean that now once stream is loaded/video inserted, the 1st
    frame is rendered
    (setMediaTime): if not playing set PAUSED state again, seems like
    seek is changing state to PLAYING. this fixes problem when stop
    seeked to begin and started playing again

    * gstplayer.cxx (processSyncMessage): when error occurs, set the
    condition so that OOo does'n waste time waiting for us to finish
    reaching PAUSED state

    * gstplayer.cxx (processSyncMessage): set condition even if we
    weren't able to get video size - might be audio only stream
    (getPreferredPlayerWindowSize): init size to 0, 0 - in case we
    don't have video size, it will fallback to system media window
    content (some icon)

    * gstplayer.cxx (processSyncMessage): when we get to paused state,
    get stream-info from playbin and look for video size. set
    condition when done
    (Player): added width, height, size condition
    (preparePlaybin): new helper method, extracted from create
    method. use fake video sink in the beggining so that we don't get
    xwindow-id message too early
    (getPreferredPlayerWindowSize): wait for size condition to be sure
    we know video size (if possible). reset video sink to default one
    (NULL) and set state to READY and immediatelly to PAUSE so that
    the default sink is relinked

2006-08-16  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>

    * gstplayer.cxx (create): set state to PAUSED so that we can query
    duration ASAP
    (processMessage): watch for state changed and query duration when
    going to PAUSED state

2006-08-15  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>

    * makefile.mk: require gstreamer-plugins-base-0.10 and link with
    gst interfaces library

    * gstwindow.cxx: make it build

    * gstplayer.cxx: removed WINNT ifdefs (relict from time when I
    thought Cedric develops on win architecture)
    (gst_pipeline_bus_callback): added sync handler for setting
    xwindow id to to video sink
    (processSyncMessage): new metrhod, process message from sync
    handler
    (create): set playbin state to READY so that playback start is
    faster
    (createPlayerWindow): implemented, we pass xwindow id in 3rd
    argument

2006-08-04  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>

    * gstplayer.cxx (create): add bus watch, watch for EOS in
    processMessage method (called from watch callback)

2006-08-02  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>

    * gstplayer.cxx: test for mpPlaybin != NULL before using it,
    initialize it in constructor to NULL and also reset it to NULL
    after unrefing
    (getDuration): check for sucessful query and the right format
    (getMediaTime): ditto,
    (setMediaTime): implemented

2006-08-01  Radek Doulik  <rodo@novell.com>

    * gstwindow.hxx: removed mpWndClass for now, so that the rest
    compiles

    * gstuno.cxx (component_getFactory): s/DirectX/GStreamer so that
    component is loaded

    * gstplayer.cxx (Player::Player): do not create gerror object, it
    is noit needed, free the error object only if created during
    initialization of gstremer
    (Player::create, start, stop): use g_main_loop only on windows
    (create): fixed ascURL declaration, added rtl namespace prefix
    (setMute): set mbMuted
    (setVolumeDB): convert avmedia volume to gstreamer volume, added
    missing NULL to the end of g_object_set call
    (getVolumeDB): convert gstreamer volume back to avmedia volume

    * gstplayer.hxx: keep g_main_loop only on win platform. make
    mnUnmutedVolume double, moved mbInitialized to the end to quiet
    compiler warning

    * gstcommon.hxx: removed wrong #include <rtl/ustring>

    * renamed source files, prefixed the names with gst so that obj
    file names do not clash with xine object files

    * makefile.mk: changed PRJNAME and TARGET to reflect
    gstreamer. enabled build on unix as well. removed win library
    references. removed source files which are not yet ported from
    SLOFILES list.
