      "message": "Usually it was \"3\" -- but tried tonight with \"1\" and \"2\" (which also fail), and the last failure tried again with \"3\"\n\nAdditional observations:\n\nAlways stops at: \"[build UIT] sc\"  in linux_clang_dbgutil \nwith \"FAILURE: \nKilled by the kill-wrapper, typically due to no stdout/-err activity during a specified timeout interval.\"\n\n(the other systems are always compiled successfully)\n\nIf I put back the \"label\" that was clipped out, then everything works -- which is why I believe the problem is there.\n\nIs it possible that removing the label has disturbed a unit test -- so that the timeout is not because of the gtk3+ but because of the change in the dialog box?",
