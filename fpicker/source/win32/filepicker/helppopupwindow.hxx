/*
    A simple popup window similary to the one the
    windows help (using WinHelp) creates when called
    with the option HELP_CONTEXTPOPUP.

    The interface is very simple but necessary for our
    needs.
    The window automatically calculates the necessary
    dimensions of the window and a appropriate show
    position based on the position the client provides.
    When the user click any mouse button or hits any key
    the window closes itself and disappears.
