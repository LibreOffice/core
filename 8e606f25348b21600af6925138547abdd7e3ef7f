      "message": "The color submenu always shows up with the additional submenus in case of gtk3. Works well for kf5, but on gen I also see Sort and Color submenus together from time to time. And Sort never opens immediately, I always have to come from another menu item. Is my approach wrong?",

What\u0027s also apparent in my effort is that there are a bunch of uitests that need to be (painfully) adjusted to the new positions/submenus",
