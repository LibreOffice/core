So this should probably be (!bHasAttrSet \u0026\u0026 !bSearchInParent)\n\nThis patch (along with the above modification) should have solved tdf#118812, but it hasn\u0027t.\n\nAll this to say that you might want to be cautious about backporting this one. However, I think it definitely DOES move forward, and don\u0027t think it would be regressive..., so in that sense there isn\u0027t a huge concern.\n\nExpect lots of change in this space in LO 6.4 or 6.5.",
