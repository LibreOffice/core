      "message": "Sorry Xisco, i meant that in my message after merging my last patch. Sorry. However that might be not enough. Today i have written a test what uses that patch and calls this marked selectObj() function, and produces the test tha same syntoms like this test. But there are good news: Replacing this to the API based selection this will work. Soon i upload that test and tomorrow (or maybe today) i fix this too. If you interested in that, i can link it to here. The py test works because that uses the API unlike this. Link and fix soon. Have a nice day!",
