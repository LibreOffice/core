      "message": "On this level there is nothing we can do about GPU acceleration - Ideally skia vulkan should have the image in the GPU memory so rendering each segment should be extremely fast.\n\nAs for this - I would really like to have the gist of the algorithm outside of OutputDevice.\n\nAnother thing that comes into my mind is that instead of converting it to a BitmapEx, we could use the VirtualDevice directly, which should be even faster as blitting devices is more direct.\n\nAlso I see the width is fixed at 256 - how can this match the wave so it results in a seamlessly continuous pattern without a visible transition between tiles...",
