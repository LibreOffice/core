      "message": "Marina/Tomaž: since OpenGL rendering has been removed and OpenGL has been kept only for slide transition (+ some canvas part but it seems already broken, see comments from tdf#145910), the goal is to reduce the number of blacklisted elements so more people may use specific OpenGL slide transitions.\n\nOf course, this patch can be reverted partially or totally anytime.\n\nAdolfo: would it be possible you bring back OpenGL part in https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/QA/FirstSteps you had removed?",

      "message": "Looking at this, most of the entries check for some driver version (and older), and by now presumably those versions should be rather old, so is there any gain in removing those? If somebody still uses those driver versions, then either the user or the vendor don\u0027t update drivers, and in such case it\u0027s probably better not to do anything. Similarly the os\u003d\"7\" entry checks for by-no-unsupported Windows 7.\n\nThe only entry I see worth removing is the nvidia entry that checks only for device id, as that one blocks the gfx card indefinitely.\n\n",
