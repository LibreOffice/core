      "message": "Marina/Tomaž: since OpenGL rendering has been removed and OpenGL has been kept only for slide transition (+ some canvas part but it seems already broken, see comments from tdf#145910), the goal is to reduce the number of blacklisted elements so more people may use specific OpenGL slide transitions.\n\nOf course, this patch can be reverted partially or totally anytime.\n\nAdolfo: would it be possible you bring back OpenGL part in https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/QA/FirstSteps you had removed?",
