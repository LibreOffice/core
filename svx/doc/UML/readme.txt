This folder contains UML diagrams for certain implementations within this project.

To view/edit them, you need "Poseidon for UML". The free community edition (which
is completely sufficient for all documents herein) is available from
http://www.gentleware.com/.

It is probably also possible to open the documents with ArgoUML, the free open source
UML tool which Poseidon for UML is based on. Visit http://argouml.tigris.org/ to
obtain ArgoUML.
