/* Construct with the root storage of the office document, with bImportCode
 * set the visual basic code will be imported into the stardocument when Import  * is called, with bCopyStorage set, the visual basic storage tree will be
 * copied completely into staroffice, so that any future export to a msoffice
 * format will retain the vba code, allowing a lossless roundtrip from
 * msoffice to staroffice and back.
 *
 * Setting bAsComment to true in Import will import the visual basic as a
 * starbasic comment. Which is currently necessary, as vb is not valid sb.
 *
 * Setting bStripped will remove the "Attribute" lines from the vb, msoffice
 * does this itself when it shows the vb code in the vbeditor, so this is
 * probably what the user expects to see when viewing the code
