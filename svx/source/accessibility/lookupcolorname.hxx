/** This is a color name lookup targeted to be used by the accessibility
    <type>DescriptionGenerator</type> class.  It encapsulates a
    <type>com.sun.star.drawing.ColorTable</type> and provides an inverse look
    up of color names for given numerical color descriptions (the RGB values
    encoded as an integer).

    <p>The implementation uses as singleton so that the
    <type>com.sun.star.drawing.ColorTable</type> object needs to be created
    only once.  That singleton instance for now lives until the application
    terminates.  However, the color table from which it takes its values may
    change during this time.  Reacting to these changes remains a task for the
    future.</p>

    @param nColor
    This integer is the sum of the 8 Bit red value shifted left 16 Bits, the
    green value shifted left 8 Bits, and the unshifted blue value.

    @return
    The returned string is either the color name of the specified color or,
    when no name exists, a string of the form "#RRGGBB" with two hexadecimal
    digits for each color component.
