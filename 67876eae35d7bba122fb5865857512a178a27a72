      "message": "The replaceTo value is copied from dz_BT.xml and needs to be adapted to \"[$￥-451]\" instead.\n\nIf all format codes are actually identical to dz_BT they wouldn\u0027t need to be copied, a ref\u003d\"dz_BT\" would do instead, also in LC_CTYPE. Are they all identical? Or wouldn\u0027t some needed to be adapted to bo_CN instead and thus explicitly specifying them here is needed? In which case also the replaceFom/replaceTo woudln\u0027t be needed. I wonder for example if date formats should be really identical for dz_BT and bo_CN, usually they depend on country conventions, also currency formats may differ.",
