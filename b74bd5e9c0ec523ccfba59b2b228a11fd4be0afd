      "message": "Hi. Yes I can, but this still not ready for merge, because the following:\nUnfortunately, the state of the \"FooterIsOn\" checkbox shows that the footer is enabled, but the assert fails (see the commented line). I think there might be an other bug with this UI element, but I do not know exactly now, where and what it is, just finding the solution for now, and soon it will be ready without the sleeps, of course :) (In addition i had to fix an other patch too, in the same time but i want to do it quickly)",
