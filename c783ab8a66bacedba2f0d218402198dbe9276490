      "message": "Hi Xisco, thanks for backporting!\n\nI can\u0027t speak for Noel, but unless I\u0027m completely missing something, this change does not affect gtk3 at all (only covers Win-specific code), so I\u0027d have read Noel\u0027s comment mostly as something like \"There are similar situations in gtk3 as well. (So it might make sense to take a look whether similar optimizations are possible there, too.)\"\n\nUnrelated to Noel\u0027s comment: With only this change as is, there are still the 2 lines actually causing the slowness, at the beginning of \u0027AccObject::UpdateActionDesc\u0027 (generates accessible description as the a11y objects are initially created):\n\n    OUString pXString \u003d m_xAccContextRef-\u003egetAccessibleDescription();\n    m_pIMAcc-\u003ePut_XAccDescription(o3tl::toW(pXString.getStr()));\n\nOn master, there were preparatory changes https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/128004 and https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/128005 , so I\u0027d suggest cherry-picking those in addition or squashing all of the three into one commit.\n\n(Just let me know in case you want me to do that.)",
