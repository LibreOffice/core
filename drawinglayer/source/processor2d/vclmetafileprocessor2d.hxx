            This processor derived from VclProcessor2D is the base class for rendering
            all feeded primitives to a classical VCL-Metafile, including all over the
            time grown extra data in comments and PDF exception data creations. Also
            printing needs some exception stuff.

            All in all it is needed to emulate the old ::paint output from the old
            Drawinglayer as long as exporters and/or filters still use the Metafile
            and the extra-data added to it (which can be seen mostly as 'extensions'
            or simply as 'hacks').
