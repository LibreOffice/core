        // I stumbled over this when hunting another problem, but I have to correct
        // this: This test does test something that is not supported. It seems to be
        // based on the *misunderstanding* that in the version of the constructor of
        // FillGradientPrimitive2D (and similar others) with two ranges the 2nd
        // B2DRange parameter 'OutputRange' is a 'clipping' parameter. This is *not*
        // the case --- it is in fact the *contrary*, it is there to *extend* the
        // usual definition/paintRange of a gradient:
        // It was originally needed to correctly display TextFrames (TF) in Writer: If you
        // have a TF in SW filled with a gradient and that TF has sub-frames, it inhertits
        // the gradient fill. Since you can freely move those sub-TFs even outside the
        // parent TF there has to be a way to not only paint gradients in ther definition
        // range (classical, all DrawObjects do that), but extended from that. This is
        // needed e.g. for linerar gradients, but - dependent of e.g. the center settings -
        // also for all other ones, all can have geometry 'outside' the DefinitionRange.
        // This is now also used in various other locations which is proof that this is
        // useful and needed. It is possible to see that basic history/reason for this
        // parameter by following the git history and why and under which circumstances
        // that parameter was originally added. Other hints are: It is *not* named
        // 'ClipRange'. Using a B2DRange to define a ClipRange topology would be bad due
        // to not being transformable, a PolyPolygon would be used in that case. Using as
        // clipping mechanism would offer a 2nd pinciple to add clipping for primitives
        // besides MaskPrimitive2D - always bad style in a sub-system. A quick look
        // on it's usages gives hints, too.
        // This means that when defining a outputRange tat resides completely *inside*
        // the definitionRange *no change* at all is done by definition since this does
        // not *extend* the target area of the gradient paint region at all. If an
        // implementation does clip and limit output to 'outputRange' that should do no
        // harm, but is not the expected/reliable way to paint primitives clipped.
        // That's why all DrawObjects with gradient fill (and other fills do the same)
        // embed the fill that is defined for a range (usually the BoundRange of a
        // PolyPolygon) in a MaskPrimitive2D defined by the outline PolyPolygon of the
        // shape. Nothing speaks against renderers detecting that combination and do
        // something optimized if they want to, especially SDPRs, but this is not
        // required. The standard embedded clipping of the mplementations of the
        // MaskPrimitive2D do the right thing.
        // This test intends to paint the lower part of a gradient, so define the
        // gradient for the full target range and embed it to a MaskPrimitive2D
