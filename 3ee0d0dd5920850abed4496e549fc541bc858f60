      "message": "I\u0027m personally ambivalent on std::make_unique. It has the advantage of exception safety, but if it\u0027s existing code then that doesn\u0027t matter. Similarly \u0027no new\u0027 seems a weak argument in a codebase where we have so many of them, and I find the new syntax slightly more readable, and I\u0027m not a fan of \u0027auto\u0027.\n\nBut specifically in these two cases, the correct solution should be not using a pointer at all. If the object is created and then destroyed in the same block, it can be created directly on the stack.\n",
