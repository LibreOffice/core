Library to interact with the Apple Remote Control on Mac

This is an early version of Martin Kahr's Remote Control Wrapper
library
(http://martinkahr.com/2007/07/26/remote-control-wrapper-20/index.html
) with modifications by Eric Bachard. Unfortunately the exact extent
of (and rationale behind) the modifications done is unknown, at least
until the original upstream source version it is based on is
found. Version control of this just starts with the monolithic commit
of the appleremote01 CWS. Some technical detail can be found in the
OOo wiki:
