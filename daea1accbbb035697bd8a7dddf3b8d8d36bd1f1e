So, you may change the commit message to something like the following, to allow better trace the problem:\n-----\ntdf#102700: fix cell range negative selection\n \nIn Calc when you select all and then do negative selection, there has a bug. The reason is in ScMultiSel::SetMarkArea that case will make nBeg larger than nEndRow and in MarkAllCols start will be larger than end.\nSo I added a condition in the if cause to make sure that nBeg is not larger than nEndRow.\n------\n",
