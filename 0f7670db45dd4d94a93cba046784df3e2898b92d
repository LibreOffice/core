The result would be rightfully different depending on the thread encoding (e.g., utf-8). On Russian Windows it\u0027s 8, because thread encoding is Win-1252, and non-Win1252 characters become question marks.\n\nStrConv (SbRtl_StrConv) does not use the third argument (LCID), which could be useful here to not depend on system \"codepage\"...",
