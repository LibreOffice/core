      "message": "given $(ARGS) would also pick up an env var of that name that happens to be set upon make invocation, it is maybe too generic a name?\n\nuser-provided $(ARGS) emphasises a problem already present with all the variable interpolations into printf arguments: this breaks if the interpolated variable contents contains printf specifiers like %s; better use %s in the printf format argument, plus a \u0027$(ARGS)\u0027 argument (which, of course, still breaks if ARGS contains single quote characters; more sophisticated processing is needed in such cases, but we happily ignore that everywhere)",
