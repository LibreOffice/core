                          * Stop / Think *

	You need to choose either a pure MPLv2 header (from the top),
or an MPLv2 on ALv2 header (from the bottom).

	If the new module you created is based in any way on an
existing module, then:

	a) if that module has an MPLv2 on ALv2 header - please use
	   this option or

	b) if the module is entirely your own work, and/or based on an
	   existing MPLv2 header - please use that header.

	Otherwise, use the pure MPLv2 header for new code.

	For any questions please contact me directly:
			    michael.meeks@collabora.com.

	Thanks !
