      "message": "You want to assert explicit pixels what value they have in this case - not calculate the ellipse path (that\u0027s what the drawing algorithm must do).\n\nFor example: if I draw an ellipse - this, that, and that pixel must be black, that pixel must be a shade of grey and that pixel must always be white. And this is how you need to write the asserting checks. \n\nIf it seems that in the test you are writing what the algorithm should do, then you are thinking about the test in a wrong way.",

      "message": "So, should I only assert the pixel of the boundary of the ellipse which I would achieve using a std::map in this case instead of checking the pixels layer-wise?\nAlso, I choose this approach of checking the ellipse via an elliptical traversal because most of the tests does this -  they traverse the bitmap in a regular fashion like traversing in a rectangular path and checking the pixels along the way etc. but since, it\u0027s seems like this is not what we\u0027re supposed to do what should be the best approach - just asserting the pixels of the shape drawn(the shape\u0027s boundary) or something else and should every test in the future use the same testing mechainism? Thanks!",
