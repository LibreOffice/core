But they seem to have increased dramatically in frequency now, across Jenkins tinderbox and \u003chttps://ci.libreoffice.org/job/gerrit_linux_clang_dbgutil/\u003e builds, witness e.g. \u003chttps://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/136281\u003e \"fix build --with-help\" being killed four times in a row.  And it looks likely that this change is the culprit.)",
