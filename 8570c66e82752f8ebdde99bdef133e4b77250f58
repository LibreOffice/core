      "message": "This is based on the underlying patch (https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/#/c/16181) that made that call safe. Actually, I wanted to know if this kind of trick (to check for nullptr \u003d\u003d this) in clone() is ok. This trick allows for localizing the check in one place, while returning consistent and meaningful result, instead of checking that multiple times in many places.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s better to convert that to static method",

Thank you!\n\nAs Gerrit administrator, I would also like to point out, that overuse of CRVW-2 votes is strongly discouraged. CRVW-1 should be sufficient. As the matter of fact, every time CRVW-2 is removed on the same change and the follow-up patch sets, it\u0027s strong indication, that this vote was abused.",
