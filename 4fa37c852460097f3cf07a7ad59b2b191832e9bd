We attempt to draw a alpha bitmap to a (virtual) device with alpha here and when we fail using the fast-path, we need to let the slow-path do it. \n\nWith a call to DrawAlphaBitmap we ignore the alpha device compeltely and just blend it to the current \"color\" device. So in case we have a transparent virtual device, the alpha of the bitmap won\u0027t be applied to the alpha of the virtual device (if DrawAlphaBitmap succeeds).",
