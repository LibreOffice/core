I\u0027ve found some interesting malfunction with the unit test document: TextBox text content converted to shape text content. We can check that later. I\u0027ve added a simplified test case to the commit description, which works as intended. Keep up the good work! (I\u0027ve found and fixed 6 other serious spelling mistakes in the Python comments, but we don\u0027t need to wait for the gerrit test, because only the comments were modified.",
