      "message": "Seth - do you build LO from git? It might actually be harder to explain what minimize/optimize do in Writer after this, but in general it \"distributes the columns proportionally\" without any respect to symmetry / guaranteed minimums.\n\nSince columns aren\u0027t so concerned with symmetry, this algorithm is probably better for content fitting.",

Those two are identical except for the table not shrinking in Writer.\n\nYes, inspired by help analysis. My second-last email said that I wanted to \"2A.) distribute proportionately, not first come first served. (This is probably much harder to do, but should be possible.)\".  Doing this made my \"1.) calculate the guaranteed minimum from the maximum table size\" irrelevant - but that too was possible.",
