It might actually be harder to explain what minimize/optimize do in Writer after this, but in general it \"distributes the columns proportionally\" without any respect to symmetry / guaranteed minimums.\n\nSince columns aren\u0027t so concerned with symmetry, this algorithm is probably better for content fitting.",

Doing this made my \"1.) calculate the guaranteed minimum from the maximum table size\" irrelevant - but that too was possible.",
