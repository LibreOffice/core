      "message": "This makes F9 recalculate at least the current cell.\nIn the context of the bug: after opening the document (which has autocalc off and was saved when not recalculated afer a change), the user can press F9 when the formulacell is selected and the cell gets recalculated.\n\nI have the strong impression that users believe that F9 means recalculate current cell and Ctrl_shift-F9 means forec recalculation of the whole document.\nThe current behaviour of F9 is -if I\u0027m not mistaken- that all dirty cells are recalculated.\n\nMy proposed \u0027fix\u0027 expands the current behaviour by setting the current cell to dirty, which without this \u0027fix\u0027 does not happen (despite pCell-\u003eSetDirtyVar()), and makes the behaviour more intuitive (again).",

      "message": "This wouldn\u0027t recalculate the current cell, but since it is done (only) during CompileXML() it sets all cells and their dependents dirty that have no specific number format applied. Actually it would not set a cell dirty that already has a number format applied. Calling SetDirtyVar() here is only meant to recalculate cells to determine a number format that was not stored in earlier versions.\n\nI still think that \"fixing\" this during import is not the correct approach. We do have the \"recalculate after load\" (or some such) setting in Options, which does exactly that.\n\nIf we wanted F9 to recalculate the current cell, regardless of whether it is in the FormulaTree, then we should intercept the F9 handling and call SetDirty() at the current cell or selected cells before calculating the tree.",
