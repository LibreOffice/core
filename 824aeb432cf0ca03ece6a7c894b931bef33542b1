      "message": "This makes F9 recalculate at least the current cell.\nIn the context of the bug: after opening the document (which has autocalc off and was saved when not recalculated afer a change), the user can press F9 when the formulacell is selected and the cell gets recalculated.\n\nI have the strong impression that users believe that F9 means recalculate current cell and Ctrl_shift-F9 means forec recalculation of the whole document.\nThe current behaviour of F9 is -if I\u0027m not mistaken- that all dirty cells are recalculated.\n\nMy proposed \u0027fix\u0027 expands the current behaviour by setting the current cell to dirty, which without this \u0027fix\u0027 does not happen (despite pCell-\u003eSetDirtyVar()), and makes the behaviour more intuitive (again).",
