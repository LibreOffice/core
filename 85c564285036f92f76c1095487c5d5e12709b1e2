      "message": "I don\u0027t understand this part. I don\u0027t have Qt6, so please fill me in. It seems like the empty optionals aren\u0027t good enough, if bIsX11 is true? So IMHO either fix the m_ScreenSaverInhibitor or lie about bIsX11 in case of Qt6? Nothing in this function uses QX11Info in case of Qt6, so this is really puzzling me. At least the DBUS-based inhibitor should work also on Qt6. winId() should return the X11 window. Or is this some temporary fix?",

      "message": "As is, the `m_ScreenSaverInhibitor` related include and the member itself  are `#if CHECK_QT5_USING_X11` in the header, which is why using it fails if not doing the same in the cxx as well.\n\nAn alternative might be to drop those checks in the header as well. Should I do that instead?\nSince fbc61e06584ff8e6d9240f8b67be8dc28ecab5b9 says \"Just some refactoring.\", my thought was that no change in behavior (like using the code in other constellations also) was intended.",
