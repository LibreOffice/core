      "message": "The \u0027p\u0027 prefix refers to a pointer, and this is a const char*, so looks OK. The \u0027s\u0027 prefix is usually used for an OUString or OString instance or a static variable, neither of them is what we have here. Could you please undo the variable renaming here? A followup patch could port const char* to OString, if you want (though I don\u0027t see much benefit here). Also we prefer separating cosmetic changes (variable renaming) and bugfixes into separate commits if possible, it helps with reviewing.",
