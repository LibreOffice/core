      "message": "\"Margin\" should be \"Entire frame\".\n\n\"left frame border\" and \"right frame border\" is the area of frame line plus padding as set in dialog page \"Border\". (Here term \"border\" has the same problem as discussed for a page.) In content it would be \"Frame region bevor frame text area\" and \"frame region after frame text area\". \"left\" of \"Right frame border\" sets the object direct after the frame text area.\nSo changing \"Margin\" and \"Entire frame\" to \"Frame border\" would be very confusing together with \"left frame border\" and \"right frame border\" and confusing in regard to the term \"border\".

      "message": "Many thanks for comment.  Actually the OP for this ticket (tdf#148519) proposed \"Entire frame\".\n\nBut now, inspired by your comment, I have made my own positioning experiments -- and I can see/understand that *Left frame border\" would be better called \"Left of frame text area\"  (and then \"Right of frame text area\").  If those changes were made, then I believe that using \"Frame border\" would not create confusion (and would be more accurate -- as argued in tdf#148519)\n\nIf this proposal makes sense, I could open a ticket for changing Left/right frame border.",

      "message": "Hi Regina -- now \"Left frame border\" and \"Right frame border\" are changed to \"Left (Right) of frame text area\" -- which removes your concern about confusion with \"Frame border\"  -- so would like to consider the question again about using \"Frame border\" here instead of \"Entire Frame\".   Reasons are given in  tdf#148519 comment 1.  Not a big deal.  But would like to move forward. Thanks.",
