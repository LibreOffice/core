      "message": "Here is a minor difference - again added specifically to avoid problematic cases (that typically come from styles - but I think this workaround was added first.) Again, it doesn\u0027t make much sense to try to keep a gigantic table together (aka force a page break). So I think that this change doesn\u0027t have much bearing on the final decision.\n\nActually, is there even any reason to add it here?  Why did I do that. Just leave it on bEmulateTableKeep (since I didn\u0027t remove it from there yet anyway). [YES - JUST LEAVE THIS COMPLETELY ALONE, SINCE WHAT CAN THIS VARIABLE ACTUALLY DO ANYWAY - NOTHING!!! IT ONLY SAYS, IS THIS MSFORMAT?]",

      "message": "This is probably the biggest difference. This was specifically added because styles are NOT supposed to cause the emulation - and people tend to do that by accident. So it might miss a few cases where WORD looks a bit different than LO - in the extreme cases where it was intentional and not accidental.  Is the simplification worth the risk?\n\nIt is possible that I could return CheckParents\u003dtrue, because before I was incorrectly setting bTryToSplit\u003dfalse. So this perhaps this isn\u0027t needed anymore, and could just be enabled again.",
