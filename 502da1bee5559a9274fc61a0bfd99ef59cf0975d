      "message": "Where is it stated that `ssh -Qkey` orders by priority?  As said before I think it doesn\u0027t given the list includes obsolete algorithms near the top.  Also `ssh-keygen -t ssh-rsa` is definitely not what we want, it\u0027s for RSA CA keys…  Please use something like this instead\n\n```\nssh -Qkey | grep -Fxq ssh-ed25519 \u0026\u0026 type\u003d\"ed25519\" || type\u003d\"rsa\"\n```\n\nto use ed25519 when supported and fallback to RSA otherwise.\n\nFinally, “better key algorithms” is subjective :-P  There is nothing wrong with RSA per se, and RSA user/host keys will remain supported for the foreseeable future once gerrit upgrades to mina sshd 2.7.",

      "message": "Ah yes indeed, however relying on undocumented options seems a bit YOLO to me…\n\nAnother thing, given (AFAIU) the point here is to make logerrit work smoothly with OpenSSH ≥8.8 and gerrit ≤3.4(?) I wonder if perhaps logerrit shouldn\u0027t be modified so `./logerrit setup` creates an ed25519 key if none exists?  But that probably belongs to another patch :-)",
