      "message": "That is still not correct.\n\nOOXML supports -90 to 90 for rotX. See part 21.2.2.157 of the spec.\n\nFrom what I conclude this makes sense with the values of rotY going from 0 to 360. If your rotX value is outside of the -90 to +90 range you can change the rotY value to move it back into that range and still have the same transformation matrix.\n\nI would need to think a bit about how to express it mathematically but this patch does not look correct like that.",
