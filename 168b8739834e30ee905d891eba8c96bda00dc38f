Maybe you feel your little snippet here doesn\u0027t deserve its own named function. Maybe we should consider decomposing the function a little more? Maybe that could be a separate ticket.",

If the intention is, as I suspect, simply to call initiatePageBreaks on each non-null element in pGridWin, I think you could communicate that better (and in a less error-prone way) with either std::for_each or a range-based for like:\n\nfor ( auto\u0026 pgw : pGridWin )\n{\n    if ( pgw )\n    {\n        pgw-\u003einitiatePageBreaks();\n    }\n}",
