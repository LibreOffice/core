      "message": "Maybe you have noticed that the Vertical option \"Entire Frame\" continues to appear for \"To Paragraph\" and \"To Anchor\" -- (though now the Vertical options for \"To Frame\" anchoring appears to be correct). \n\nI have made a test file to convince myself that \"Entire Frame\" and \"Paragraph Text Area\" are identical -- but I do not understand why Entire Frame continues to appear.\n\nAnyway -- here is a first proposal for a patch that removes \"Margin\" (now \"Entire Frame\") from the options.  \n\nI will mention this issue in the BZ ticket, but first I want to be sure that I am on the right track here.  Thanks.",
