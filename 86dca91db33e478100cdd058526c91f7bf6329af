      "message": "Yes, this is only nominally a style. Draw shapes in Writer only have direct formatting, and then there is this hack to assign the special Graphics or Frame parent style to shapes. If one of them is the case, then that becomes a Writer textframe or a Writer picture. In other cases, we create shared/Draw shapes.\n\nThe problem here is that it\u0027s a valid scenario to try to rename all styles, so you can merge 2 documents together just by manipulating zip/xml, but that doesn\u0027t play nicely with the hardcoded parent style name whitelist. Relaxing the \"match\" to \"has the prefix\" is meant to keep the whitelisting but allow the doc merging scenario.\n\nDoes that help?",

      "message": "\u003e Does that help?\n\nAbsolutely; yes I understand the idea, was just wondering how (if) these styles are exposed to UI (I see from your explanation now that they are not).\n\nI have played with the objects a little by copying them to Draw, changing styles there, and copying back to Writer - to see if that way, we may trick other naming to their styles - but indeed, it didn\u0027t allow me (actually, on save, I lost the parent style name at all ...)\n\nSo since this is not exposed to user, this looks fine ðŸ˜Š",
