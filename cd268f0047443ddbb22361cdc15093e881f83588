      "message": "aBoundRect is an out param, so possibly it\u0027s unnecessary to call SdrObject::GetCurrentBoundRect, which is documented to be \"expensive and sometimes problematic\"?\n\nSee also SdrTextObj::GetFontScaleY, that seems to solve the same problem (added in https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/49742/), which had a problem of not initializing outliner properly (I\u0027m fixing it now). Interesting that in my test case, SdrTextObj::GetFontScaleY returns proper 0.86 (86%), while xShape-\u003egetPropertyValue(\"TextFitToSizeScale\") gives Any(sal_Int16(22)), i.e. 22%. Does GetTextFitToSizeScale suffer from never setting the outliner\u0027s SdrTextObj properly?",
