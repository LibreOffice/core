      "message": "I can\u0027t seem to make that work, I get an error stating that there is no StringResourceWithStorage::create that takes one argument. However I may very well call it incorrectly.\n\nI guess we can\u0027t actually create the StringResourceWithStorage object fully until we have a proper location for it. I\u0027ll try to find some time to debug where this is actually given the location. \n\nAnyway maybe this should be moved down to the catch statement? I believe it\u0027s the only time we need it, otherwise it will be initialized and created further down.",
