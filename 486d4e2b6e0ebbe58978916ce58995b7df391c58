      "message": "Idieally, this should be implemented as a CppUnittest, there is no reason why a UItest is needed. In fact, I converted your previous uitest from part 1 and part 2 in https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/125808. Mysteriously, jenkins fails on mac and linux release ( not with a debug build ) so something fishy is going on... is it because the feature is incomplete ?",

On the other hand not really understood why it fails on mac and Linux platforms however i\u0027ll take a look, and try to solve the issue. It might be because this is incomplete, but i think it should work...",
