      "message": "I suggest you have a closer look at indexOf(), e.g. its second argument, and possibly lastIndexOf() as well. Surely it\u0027s not necessary to a search for leading/trailing line space (if that\u0027s what it does) in such a complicated way.\n\nMoreover, I don\u0027t actually get the point of this. Isn\u0027t the patch supposed to be only about inserting a separating space if necessary? Why care about multiple lines at all?",
