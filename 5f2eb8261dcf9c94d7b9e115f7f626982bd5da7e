      "message": "The focus is now changed, but is this meant to fix the actual bug, and read the content of \"Not in dictionary\"? Which screen reader do you use?\nI don\u0027t get the desired output with the default screen reader of GNOME, and the gtk3 UI. On the other hand, without this fix, by changing the focus manually I can hear appropriate message when the related text box gets focus.",

However, if the focus is being changed, it should definitely be detected by the screen reader too. I will check enabling the default one t check too, in the meantime, could you guide me to the code pointer that would be there for detection by the screen reader?",

I\u0027ve added him as cc here.\nOn the other hand, my point is that you should test your submissions to make sure that it actually fixes the bug. In other words, the main goal of you should be bug fix. Thus, the first step should be reproducing the bug, and then trying to develop a solution to fix that. I suggest that you use GNOME and Orca to reproduce the bug, and test your solution against it.",
