      "message": "Can we have a generalized code path to make information labels smaller across several dialogs? This would be a way to solve e.g. tdf#119827 (where I attempted to make labels smaller via GtkBuilder’s “scale” attribute), and there are more dialogs where I would love to set some text apart in a typographical hierarchy scale, to aid in their visual parsing.",
