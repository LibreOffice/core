      "message": "So, this is incorrect in two ways:\n\n1. it puts the files into a wrong directory. I double-checked in scp2 and they should be directly in share/gallery.\n\n2. the source path is wrong. The source dir is the top-level dir of the unpacked tarball, i.e., $(WORKDIR)/UnpackedTarball/gallery-pack. That means that the files must be listed including a subpath: accessories/sg1010.sdg etc. This is why make complains.",
