Here are some more observations:\n\n- even if the bad RTF import happens, saving it to ODT and reloading it makes the problem go away, which suggest to fix the problem on the import side\n\n- Word seems to ignore these values, so probably it\u0027s good if we do the same\n\n- this approach helps all the existing RTF exported documents out there, while fixing this on the export side would only help new documents\n\nBased on this it seems fixing this on the import side has more advantages than the export side.\n\nBut you are right, it may make sense to fix the export side as well, RTF export should not write that problematic picw/pich in the first place. But what is correct there is not entirely clear, given that Word ignores the value. :-) (And the spec is quite terse here.) Does that make sense?",
