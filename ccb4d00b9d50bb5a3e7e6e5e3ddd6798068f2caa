      "message": "At first, I was wondering whether it was a good idea to have LO crash in case \u0027FontWidth_FORCE_EQUAL_SIZE\u0027 was used, rather than falling back to any of the other cases, even if it does not result exactly in the \"expected\" behaviour...\n\nHowever, since \u0027git grep FontWidth_FORCE_EQUAL_SIZE\u0027 on current master gives \n\n\u003e include/tools/fontenum.hxx:                 FontWidth_FORCE_EQUAL_SIZE\u003dSAL_MAX_ENUM };\n\u003e vcl/qt5/Qt5Font.cxx:        case FontWidth_FORCE_EQUAL_SIZE:\n\u003e vcl/qt5/Qt5Font.cxx:            assert(false \u0026\u0026 \"FontWidth_FORCE_EQUAL_SIZE not implementable for QFont\");\n\nthat is maybe only a theoretical question in the end? (haven\u0027t looked at it further, but it\u0027s not apparent what that value is used for then, other than possibly providing a dummy default value to initialize variables with?)",

      "message": "As I understand these *FORCE_EQUAL_SIZE values, they are just there for UNO compatibility. Actually greping for it doesn\u0027t find any assignment, then one in vcl/source/app/unohelp.cxx. The other similar convert functions in there don\u0027t handle *FORCE_EQUAL_SIZE at all. In any case it seems I originally wanted to avoid the default switch to get an warning about unhandled enums (if they ever get expanded, which I also doubt). And it\u0027s an assert, so will never hit in a release.\n\nIn hindsight, all this seems just cargo cult. I\u0027ll prepare 2nd patch to get rid of it.",
