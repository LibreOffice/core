If possible, could you please point to a screenshot/sample of the new layout?)\n\nThanks!

      "message": "I see the new layout - great!\n\nThe numeric ids may be useful for debugging - but my idea is to discourage their use in macros and extensions, so whatever you might consider doable (e.g., a note) would be fine.\n\n\u003e HXX files are referenced by their index and line numbers\n\nI suggest to link to corresponding places on the wiki page: I had difficulty understanding what those numbers are; when I read the description, I still didn\u0027t easily understand that \"index\" refers to the sources list at the bottom.
