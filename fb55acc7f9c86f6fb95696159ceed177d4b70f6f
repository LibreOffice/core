E.g., a user installing to D:\\Программы\\személyes\\LibreOffice.\n\nOn Windows, you either need to make sure to pass UTF-8 path here, and convert to whcar_t* in the function and use API that takes that wide string, or change the function argument to std::wstring and offload conversion to the caller.",
