E.g., in\n\n    Resolves tdf#122998 - Position of all/none checkboxes in Autofilter\n\nthe word \"Resolves\" has no useful meaning; and the \"Position of all/none checkboxes in Autofilter\" tells about what was addressed, but omits *how*. Using this instead:\n\n    tdf#122998: move all/none checkboxes above listbox in Autofilter\n\nbrings every interesting piece of information right to the header, and allows even to limit the commit message to a single header line without body, and without loosing value.",
