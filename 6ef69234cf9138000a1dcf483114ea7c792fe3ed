      "message": "Please look at this my comment above. It was pointing you the very relevant code long ago; please whenever you get a reply, build a habit of walking through *every* comment, and acting on every one: you may change something and just mark it \"resolved\"; or you may add a comment to the comment - a disagreement, a request for clarification, etc - so *every* comment should finally get \"resolved\" state.\n\nSpecifically, here we see that bCustomPreview is used immediately to initialize the custom renderer for the box columns - and that custom rendered is only used when we have \"preview\" activated. This is the heart of the preview - and you ignored my comment pointing to it.",
