      "message": "Thanks for the catch:) I will update \u0026 check and send a new one.\n\nLater:\nThere was a re-definition in file DrawImpressCommands.xcu, i removed it. So it now uses the one in GenericCommands.xcu.\n\nI\u0027d also want to remove \"...\" from \"Edit Hyperlink...\" :) But i am not sure about how translation works in core side (there might be a 1:1 mapping with text). So i didn\u0027t touch it.\n\nThanks again for your comment.",
