(Maybe it would be beneficial to make rGeoProp const?)\n\n(And two more nitpicks: \"this Sequence\" -\u003e \"aGeoPropSeq\", and end the comment in a colon to indicate that it appertains to the code following it.)",

But maybe that\u0027s just me, and I\u0027m exaggerating a bit.\n\n\u003e rGeoProp *is* now const, since the change *removed* non-const operator[], and so the other, const operator[] is used, which returns a const reference.\n\nindeed, good point :)",
