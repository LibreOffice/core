      "message": "Thanks for this, definitely an improvement.\n\nAs noted in https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/129288, there are currently no Writer construct that could represent SDTs perfectly -- I think in this case (this change) the trouble is that if you map SDTs to fields, then you can\u0027t have multiple text portions inside the field, while SDTs support that. I plan to add a new Writer text attribute (\"content control\") to support this use-case. Hopefully I can start working towards that later this week. If you see any trouble with that, let me know.\n\nAnd great that you added a test for this, this allows me to be more confident that I won\u0027t break too many things when I try to change the existing field/fieldmark mess with something that is closer to the SDT requirements.",
