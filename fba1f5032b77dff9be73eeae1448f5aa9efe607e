Honestly when I see a blank line in a place like this I would generally assume it\u0027s a mistake, perhaps a merge issue or someone translated line endings strangely. But if this is an intentional style choice I\u0027ll make a point of maintaining it.",

But if to be removed, that *must* be a separate re-formatting commit, not part of this functional commit, where the formatting changes only introduces noise, and makes review harder.",
