(While it is always advisable to use the SDK from the lowest-common-denominator product that is targeted by an extension, to avoid accidental use of features only introduced later, this case is of course somewhat different in that, even if the author is careful not to use any such features that might not be available in old versions, they will just not be able at all to create such an extension with a recent SDK.)",
