      "message": "Hello. Here\u0027s another patch, in which I\u0027ve made the changes suggested by Stephen (i.e dropped the redundant groups, and used enumeration constraints wherever possible). I\u0027ve also pointed out which C++ enumerations point to which flag in the \u003cinfo\u003e tags. I\u0027ve also checked the tests which were failing (and they are now passing on my end, after Xisco\u0027s patch).",
