      "message": "Fair enough.  The OP suggested something similar - but wanted it only to appear only from Value2 and up.  \n\nI argued against the idea - partly because (in Function Wizard at least), there will be a full explanation of SWITCH (also of default) that will remain in view, and partly because it will also be a tooltip.  Won\u0027t you (and expert users) get tired of always being reminded about the default in the tooltip?  I will follow Kaganski\u0027s hill-climbing principle:  make an improvement, until a better improvement comes.  (-:",

I don\u0027t care of the content of tooltips that I don\u0027t watch (i.e., I don\u0027t pay attention to them when I know what I write); and I definitely don\u0027t think that additional info is wrong for those that I *do* read (when I\u0027m unsure what it is for). If I pay attention to this tooltip, it means I don\u0027t remember its purpose \u003d\u003e it\u0027s fine to see all the related info.",
