      "message": "So with this block removed, a corresponding gradient (if other than Tango Green on pos 0) will never get preselected on initial opening of the dialog\n\nTry assigning e.g. Tango Red gradient to a shape. Confirm with OK, shape gets red gradient fill. Open area dialog again and see 1st Tango Green selected \u003d\u003e regression\n\nI obviously failed to get my point across. When I said \"remove m_pPos variable\", I actually meant \"please make it non-member, it is only used in this function and nowhere else, so local variable will do the trick as well\"",
