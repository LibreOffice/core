    This macro is appended by cppumaker to every first member of a struct, if
    the struct inherits from a base struct and the first member is neither
    double nor sal_[u]Int64.  (The double/sal_[u]Int64 restriction is due to a
    bug in GCC prior to version 3.3, which would cause __alignof__ of such a
    struct to become 8 instead of 4 if CPPU_GCC3_ALIGN were added to its first
    member.)
