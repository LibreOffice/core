      "message": "Just say \"processes\". \"CPU\" is a bit vague, people might wander whether it means a CPU chip (with perhaps multiple cores), or a \"processor\"? But actually \"processes\" is not really correct either; even in a build with no parallelism at all there of course are a lot of processes existing at the same time (but just one \"runnable\"),,, Hmm, should the switch then be changes to --with-parallelism?",
