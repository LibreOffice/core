      "message": "Sorry for asking here in the unrelated change. Just wanted to ask for your opinion:\n\nhere we \"update\" fObjectRotation using fAngle. We use fObjectRotation above (line 1580) to rotate around maRect.TopLeft(); and we use nAngle to rotate around rRef. Doesn\u0027t it introduce some garbage?\n\nWouldn\u0027t it be better to use e.g. B2DHomMatrix to store the combined transformation, and use it consistently all over the place, instead of using these separate rotations, scalings, shears, etc?",

      "message": "Armin had started something, see aoo/aw080. I see some problems: (1) SdrObjCustomShape is derived from SdrTextObj, but mirror is handled different, which affects the rotation angle. (2) The matrix which you get by TRGetBaseGeometry has a mathematical wrong shear angle. (3) Using a matrix would require to compose/decompose it in many places. (4) Who will do it? (5) The change would be huge. How would an intermediate state look?",
