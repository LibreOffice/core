      "message": "is this legal? I mean, it probably works, in the sense that it results in an empty g_aRecording vector, but is the state of a moved object guaranteed to be \"empty\" ? I thought that the only thing a moved object could do would be to call it\u0027s destructor?\nPerhaps a std::swap is a better idea?\nFeel free to ignore me if this makes no sense :-)",

(But of course no difference in practice, since aRecording is empty.)",
