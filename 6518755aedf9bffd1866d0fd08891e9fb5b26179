You map:\n-179|180 to 0|180\n-179|180 to 90|359\n\nwhile OOXML requires the values to be in the range -90 to +90\n\nI mentioned already that most likely the places where we have a value of -180|-90 and 90|180 need a more complex algorithm that also adapts the y rotation.\n\nObviously the current code can\u0027t be correct as it violates the spec.",
