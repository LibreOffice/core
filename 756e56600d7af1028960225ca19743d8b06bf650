      "message": "(It took me a month to understand what this code was supposed to do, so who is being stupid here?:).\nFirst, I find out if the destination is 1 cell or a range, and if the source area is large than the selected destination area [1271-1279]. The largest area of these is taken for the comparisons [1282-1283], as this will be the actual destination area (copy/paste some blocks and you will see what I mean if my text is not clear).\nThe first comparison is whether source and destination area overlap [1284-1288]. When the source area contains references, these probably will go wrong when there is an overlap. As this may produce data loss (e.g. formulas that get wrong references), it _must_ be avoided. This code was there from the beginning, but with errors, disabling the wrong options. My first patch fixed only a part of that.\nThe second comparison [1294-1327] handles something else, the question whether shifting the cells in the destination area will fit on the sheet. This comparison is not necessary for integrity, but for user friendliness. Without the comparison, the user will get a message that the result will not fit and no harm is done. Rainer Bielefeld wanted the possibilty of fitting on the sheet reflected in the en/disabling of the shift options.\nI do this check by going from the MAXCOL/MAXROW position back for the width/height of the destination area and checking if the cells are empty. If not, paste+shift will not fit and the appropiate shit option is disabled.\nI feared a performance penalty with this method, but I tested it on an old. slow machine (complete build of Libreofiice takes 24hrs) with a destination area almost MAXROW high and that gave no noticeable delay.\nBut because of this performance penalty danger, i want you to have a good look at the code. Perhaps it will be safer to leave it out, perhaps there are more efficient ways to check the fitting.\n\nI hope my proze give you the explanation you want.\nPerhaps I should put some of it in the code as comment?",

      "message": "I agree, I don\u0027t like the loops either. But I see no alternative. To check if opy+paste will fit, I must check that every cell that will be shifted off the sheet is empty. \nI looked at your suggestion, and possibly ScTable::FindAreaPos will make the code easier to read (but a row-loop must be maintained when checking the cols and vice versa). It will not make the code more efficient, but probably more robust.\nI don\u0027t have a strong preference for one of the other (perhaps a slight preference for FindAreaPos because of the extra robustness).",
