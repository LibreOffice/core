      "message": "Is this really a locale dependent number? Not just a \u0027.\u0027 dot decimal separator used (VBA source code)? The original code did only a simple conversion. And do we actually want to ignore (scan away) group separators? Note this will make fail documents that so far were not locale dependent here. If this is going to be locale dependent now then we\u0027ll need to have some magic to check for dot decimal separator numbers first to not fail on those.",

      "message": "I was not sure about a locale dependent number, but now I think that it should be the VBA format using the dot decimal separator. Otherwise, marcos do not work for different locales and a specific macro has to be changed for every document using a different locale.\n\nFor the group separators, could you give me an example? As far as I understand, Autofilters may have different criterias, for instance, Worksheets(\"Sheet1\").Range(\"A1\").AutoFilter Field:\u003d1, Criteria1:\u003d\"\u003e10\", _Operator:\u003dxlAnd, Criteria2:\u003d\"\u003c20\"",
