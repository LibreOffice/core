# Various places in sc rely on floating-point division by zero to produce
# infinity (as triggered by CppunitTest_sc_functions_test); silence those UBSan
# reports by adding
# suppressions=/path-to-this/solenv/sanitizers/ubsan-suppressions to the
# UBSAN_OPTIONS environment variable (and making sure to compile with
# -fsanitize-recover=float-divide-by-zero):
