Tools and makefile fragments necessary for compilation

This module contains many tools and makefile configuration pieces,
critical for building LibreOffice:

bin/
    contains lots of tools used during the build:

    concat-deps*
        these aggregate, and remove duplicates from module
        dependencies, to accelerate build times.

    make_installer.pl
        this script executes the compiled instructions from
        the scp2/ module to create an installer, and/or to
        do a local install for the smoketest.

gbuild/
    implementation of the LibreOffice build system
    See gbuild/README for more info.

gdb/
    lots of nice python helpers to make debugging -much- easier
    that (eg.) print UCS2 strings as UTF-8 on the console to
    help with debugging.

inc/
    old / increasingly obsolete dmake setup and includes, we are
    trying to entirely rid ourselves of this

src/
    useful standard / re-usable component map files for components
    which shouldn't export anything more than a few registration
    symbols.
