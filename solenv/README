Tools and makefile fragments necessary for compilation

This module contains many tools and makefile configuration pieces,
critical for building LibreOffice:

bin/
	contains lots of tools used during the build:

	concat-deps*
		these aggregate, and remove duplicates from module
		dependencies, to accelerate build times.

	make_installer.pl
		this script executes the compiled instructions from
		the scp2/ module to create an installer, and/or to
		do a local install for the smoketest.

gbuild/
	the (shiny new) gnumake build makefile fragments we are
	migrating the codebase to use.

gdb/
	lots of nice python helpers to make debugging -much- easier
	that (eg.) print UCS2 strings as UTF-8 on the console to
	help with debugging.

inc/
	old / increasingly obsolete dmake setup and includes, we are
	trying to entirely rid ourselves of this

src/
	useful standard / re-usable component map files for components
	which shouldn't export anything more than a few registration
	symbols.
