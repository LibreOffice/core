# The install names of our dynamic libraries contain a special segment token
# that denotes where the dynamic library is located in the installation set.
# The segment token consists of "@", optionally followed by ".", followed by 50
# "_", followed by a location token (one of "URELIB", "OOO", "OXT", or "NONE").
#
# Typically, the segment token is the first segment of a relative install name.
# But the segment token may also appear within an absolute install name.  That
# is useful when tunnelling the segment token into the external build process
# via a --prefix configure switch, for example.
#
# When another dynamic library or an executable links against such a dynamic
# library, the path recorded in the former to locate the latter is rewritten
# according to the below %action table.  The result path consists of the prefix
# from the action table followed by the suffix of the dynamic library's install
# name.  If the special segment token does not contain the optional "." after
# the "@", the suffix consists of all segments after the special token segment.
# If the special token segment does contain the optional ".", then the suffix
# consists of just the last segment of the original install name.
#
# That latter case is useful for libraries from external modules, where the
# external build process locates them in some sub-directory.
