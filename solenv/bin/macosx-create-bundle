# Documentation
# -------------
#
# The purpose of this script to take Mac OS X executables and shared libraries
# and package them into the required Mac OS X bundle format.
#
# This script has the following usage:
# 	macosx-create-bundle file1 [file2] ... [fileN]
#
# Note that file1 through fileN can in either of the following formats:
# - A file name
# - A file name and a directory to look for missing files. To use this option,
#   use the following format:
#     filename=directory
#
# The file argument is the file that you want to package into a Mac OS X
# bundle. Currently, this script will only package executables and shared
# libraries.
#
# The output for each executable will be a bundle named <file>.app and
# the output for each shared library will be a symlink from libfoo.jnilib 
# back to libfoo.dylib.
# These output directories will be in the same directory as the executable or
# shared library.

# Code
