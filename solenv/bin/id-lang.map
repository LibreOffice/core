# Welcome to the mkid language mapper.
#
# The format of each line is:
#
#       <pattern> <language> [options]
#
# Filenames are matched top-to-bottom against the patterns, and the
# first match is chosen.  The special language `IGNORE' means that
# this file should be ignored by mkid.  The options are
# language-specific command-line options to mkid.
#
# If a file name doesn't match any pattern, it is assigned the default
# language.  The default language may be specified here with the
# special pattern `**', or overridden from the mkid command-line with
# the `--default-lang=LANG' option.
#
# The special pattern `***' means to include the named file that
# immediately follows.  If no file is named, then the default system
# language mapper file (i.e., this file) is included.

# Default language
**          IGNORE  # Although this is listed first,
                # the default language pattern is
                # logically matched last.
