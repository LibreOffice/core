NAME
       gbuild - GNU make based build system for LibreOffice

SYNOPSIS
       make [ -f makefile ] [ options ] [ variable=value ... ] [ targets ] ...

IMPORTANT OPTIONS
       -s Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.

       -n Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them.
       -k Continue as much as possible after an error.

       -j Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously.
       -l Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are
          others jobs running and the load average is at least load.

       -t Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them)
          instead of running their commands.
       -W Pretend that the target file has just been modified.
       -o Do not remake the file file even if it is older than its
          dependencies, and do not remake anything on account of changes in file.

       -p Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results from
          reading the makefiles.
       --debug=b debug make run, see GNU make man page for details

       (descriptions from GNU make man page)

AVAILABLE TARGETS
       all              build product and run unit tests (default goal)
       build            build product
       unitcheck        run unit tests
       slowcheck        run slow unit tests
       subsequentcheck  run system tests (requires full installation)
       check            run unit tests and if in toplevel subsequentcheck
       clean            remove all generated files
       showdeliverables show the targets delivered to OUTDIR and their source
       showmodules      show the modules that would be loaded
       debugrun         starts the dev-install instance and allows tests to be run
                        against it
       <module>         build the named module
       <module>.clean   clean the named module
       <module>.all     for dmake modules only, build the named module and
                        the pre-requisite modules for this module
       <module>.deliver for dmake modules only, deliver the named module
       cmd              execute the command contained in the variable cmd=""
                        in a shell with config_host.mk or config_build.mk
                        environement set. (see gb_SIDE)

INTERACTIVE VARIABLES:
       DEBUG / debug   If not empty, build with DBGLEVEL=1 (see below).
       ENABLE_SYMBOLS / enable_symbols
                       If not empty, build with debug symbols. Automatically
                       enabled by DEBUG/debug.
       DBGLEVEL / dbglevel
                       If not empty, force the debug level to the specified value. The
                       debug level is passed to the source code through OSL_DEBUG_LEVEL
                       macro.
                       0 = no debug
                       1 = symbols + no optimizations
                       2 = symbols + no optimizations + extra debug output. OSL_TRACE
                           starts being active on this level.
                       3... = symbols + no optimizations + extra debug output (usually
                              extremely verbose). Levels > 2 are not used very much.

       TIMELOG / timelog
                       If not empty enable the RTL_LOGFILE_* time logging facility.
                       export RTL_LOGFILE=rtl_logfile.nopid when running office, to
                       get timestamps written out.
       YACCFLAGS       Add as flags for YACC parser generator invocation.
       CPPFLAGS        Add as preprocessor flags for C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ compilation.
       CFLAGS          Add as compiler flags for plain C compilation.
       CXXFLAGS        Add as compiler flags for C++ compilation.
       OBJCFLAGS       Add as compiler flags for Objective C compilation.
       OBJCXXFLAGS     Add as compiler flags for Objective C++ compilation.
       LDFLAGS         Add as linker flags.
       gb_FULLDEPS     Generate and use dependencies (on by default, handle with care).
       gb_COLOR        Use ASCII color output.
       gb_TITLES       Show progress in terminal title.
       gb_Side         Either "host" of "build" (default to "host").
                       determine if config_host.mk or config_build.mk is used to
                       set the build environment.
