NAME
       gbuild - GNU make based build system for LibreOffice

SYNOPSIS
       make [ -f makefile ] [ options ] [ variable=value ... ] [ targets ] ...

IMPORTANT OPTIONS
       -s Silent operation; do not print the commands as they are executed.

       -n Print the commands that would be executed, but do not execute them.
       -k Continue as much as possible after an error.

       -j Specifies the number of jobs (commands) to run simultaneously.
       -l Specifies that no new jobs (commands) should be started if there are
          others jobs running and the load average is at least load.

       -t Touch files (mark them up to date without really changing them)
          instead of running their commands.
       -W Pretend that the target file has just been modified.
       -o Do not remake the file file even if it is older than its
          dependencies, and do not remake anything on account of changes in file.

       -p Print the data base (rules and variable values) that results from
          reading the makefiles.
       --debug=b debug make run, see GNU make man page for details

       (descriptions from GNU make man page)

INTERACTIVE VARIABLES:
       BUILDTOOLTRACE  Run all commands that invoke built tools in strace,
                       valgrind or a debugger:
                       BUILDTOOLTRACE='$(DEVENV) /debugexe' PARALLELISM=1 make
       DEBUG / debug   If not empty, build as with --enable-debug.
       ENABLE_SYMBOLS / enable_symbols
                       If not empty, build as with --enable-symbols.
       DBGLEVEL / dbglevel
                       If not empty, force the debug level to the specified value. The
                       debug level is passed to the source code through OSL_DEBUG_LEVEL
                       macro.
                       0 = no debug (as with --disable-debug)
                       1 = debugging information + no optimizations (as with --enable-debug)
                       (Note that levels higher than 2 are used only by obsolete debugging
                       features. Use SAL_INFO/SAL_WARN with a specific area for extra debug
                       output in new code.)
                       2 = debugging information + no optimizations + extra
                           debug output. OSL_TRACE starts being active on this
                           level.
                       3... = debugging information + no optimizations + extra
                              debug output (usually extremely verbose). Levels
                              > 2 are not used very much.
       PARALLELISM     If not empty, pass argument on as the -j switch
                       to recursive make invocations. Useful to
                       lower/increase build parallelism individually.
       LEXFLAGS        Append flags for LEX scanner generator invocation.
       YACCFLAGS       Append flags for YACC parser generator invocation.
       CPPFLAGS        Append preprocessor flags for C/C++/ObjC/ObjC++ compilation.
       CFLAGS          Override compiler flags for plain C compilation.
       ENVCFLAGS       Append compiler flags for plain C compilation.
       CXXFLAGS        Override compiler flags for C++ compilation.
                       Note: this overrides default optimization and debug
                       flags; to append flags without overriding, use:
                       CXXFLAGS='$(call gb_LinkTarget__get_debugcxxflags,$(1)) -Wfoo'
       ENVCFLAGSCXX    Append compiler flags for C++ compilation.
       OBJCFLAGS       Override compiler flags for Objective C compilation.
       OBJCXXFLAGS     Override compiler flags for Objective C++ compilation.
       LDFLAGS         Override linker flags.
       gb_FULLDEPS     Generate and use dependencies (on by default, handle with care).
       gb_COLOR        Use ASCII color output.
       gb_TITLES       Show progress in terminal title.
       gb_Side         Either "host" or "build" (default to "host").
                       determine if config_host.mk or config_build.mk is used to
                       set the build environment.
       gb_DBGARGS      Append these arguments to GDBs "set args" command for
                       debugrun. Double quotes will be automatically escaped.
