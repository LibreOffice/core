for an archived overview of the new build system.

See
   ./solenv/doc/gbuild
for a commented class/API heirachy of gbuild written in C++ syntax. It was not
intended for any use beyond to generate nicelooking docs with the doxygen
doxygen documentation generator from it. It likely is quite outdated these
days.
