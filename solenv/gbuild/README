GBuild is a set of makefile macros built on top of gmake that attempts to simplify LibreOffice development.

for online build-system documentation.

for an archived overview of the new build system.

See
   ./solenv/doc/gbuild
for a commented class/API hierarchy of gbuild written in C++ syntax. It was not
intended for any use beyond to generate nicelooking docs with the doxygen
doxygen documentation generator from it. It likely is quite outdated these
days.
