      "message": "This makes me uneasy, treating this specific uno structure differently from other uno struct feels wrong. This coercing of the type ( and actually I am not totally sure of which scenarios this is called ) could be error prone, I\u0027d worry that this might happen unexpectedly ( and also there afaik is no similar precedent in libreoffice basic )",

      "message": "Same as previous, I think this could lead to some unexpected results. I really would prefer that uno structures are treated just as structures and no special conversion especially in such a core base value function. Also there is the issue of the lack of symmetry now between ::Get \u0026 ::Put\n\nIf one wanted to set an error then SbxBase::SetError( SbxERR_CONVERSION ) probably would be the appropriate one",
