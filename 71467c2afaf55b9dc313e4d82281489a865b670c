      "message": "Looks reasonable.\n\nBut is there a relevant bug report about this? It is very desirable to have it filed and mentioned here in commit message (like \"tdf#NNN: Prevent ...\"). That would enable to understand how the problem manifests, and *how to check if it reproduces or not* - e.g., in case when there\u0027s a suspicion that the cause is fixed elsewhere, and the code is being cleaned up.\n\nBeing not familiar with the code, I have a question: can\u0027t it break loading of *another* icon in a nested call this way?",
