      "message": "I\u0027m not convinced that changes like these, esp. in include files that are part of the stable URE interface (i.e., are consumed by 3rd-party code, which may expect a certain level of stability), are actually good.  For better or worse, for many of the C++ include files in the URE interface, there is a \"low-level\" .h file (defining classes, declaring inline functions) and a corresponding \"higher-level\" .hxx file (including the low-level .h file and defining inline functions).  Occasionally, this may help avoid circular dependencies (which is the rationale for the cppumaker-generated .hdl/.hpp file combos), but client code is in general supposed to consider the \"low-level\" .h file an implementation detail of the .hxx file, and only include the .hxx file directly.",
