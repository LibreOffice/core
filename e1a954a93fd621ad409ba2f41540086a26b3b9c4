      "message": "Thanks, these are good points. I tried avoiding a plain int since passing arbitrary numbers would not be self-documenting while being error prone. I gave the enum entries more sensible names and added proper comment (didn\u0027t know @cond INTERNAL could go over enums as well). Let me know if it can be improved further, would be happy to polish it as necessary.",
