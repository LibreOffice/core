      "message": "Thank you for the updates!\n\nUnfortunately this [and the code that leads to this] is not what I want ;-)  Instead, I want to use the Graphics here, with its setPdfData, which takes care of the roundtrip etc. - especially I don\u0027t want us to generate the PNGs (that are in the end backed by a Graphics anyway - if I\u0027m not mistaken).\n\nCan you please extend the setPdfData in a way that it actually uses a shared stream, and probably also about the page to render?  Miklos - do you have a code pointer or two, please? :-)\n\nWhen we go the \u0027Graphics\u0027 way, it will nicely align with the Tomaz\u0027s new caching rework I hope.",
