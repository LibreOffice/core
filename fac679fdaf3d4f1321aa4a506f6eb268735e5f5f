      "message": "Thank you for the updates!\n\nUnfortunately this [and the code that leads to this] is not what I want ;-)  Instead, I want to use the Graphics here, with its setPdfData, which takes care of the roundtrip etc. - especially I don\u0027t want us to generate the PNGs (that are in the end backed by a Graphics anyway - if I\u0027m not mistaken).\n\nCan you please extend the setPdfData in a way that it actually uses a shared stream, and probably also about the page to render?  Miklos - do you have a code pointer or two, please? :-)\n\nWhen we go the \u0027Graphics\u0027 way, it will nicely align with the Tomaz\u0027s new caching rework I hope.",

      "message": "vcl::ImportPDF() in vcl/source/filter/ipdf/pdfread.cxx:233 currently takes a uno::Sequence\u003csal_Int8\u003e, that\u0027s the native PDF data. You could change that to a std::shared_ptr\u003cuno::Sequence\u003csal_Int8\u003e\u003e, that way in case we import multiple pages from the same pdf, in fact we only store the PDF file only once.\n\nThe idea is that we always work with a Graphic (which can contain a metafile or a bitmap -- in the pdfium case currently it contains a bitmap), and that has the original PDF as metadata; so later during the PDF export it is possible to write the original (vector) PDF, not the bitmap. I hope that\u0027s enough info to get you started.",
