      "message": "Interesting. I guess there is no definition of what kind of a line a point is (or no points at all), but in that case, maybe we should default to the value that saves some cpu cycles?\n\nIn this case if we return true, we will not try to render, which seems to be more sensible. Assuming, of course, a single point doesn\u0027t render to anything (would we show a single pixel value?). But if it does, I suggest we return true for .count() \u003d\u003d 0, and false for 1.\n\nThen again, maybe it\u0027s not worth it.",

      "message": "\u003e we should default to the value that saves some cpu cycles\n\nYes, a 1-pooint polygon is a nonsense, this check is here just to not read past the bounds of the point array. And the reason I return false there is to avoid the special \"hori or vert only\" path. I *think* that is the cheaper.\n\nThe decision is theoretical though, I think the point is to not crash on unusual input. :-)",
