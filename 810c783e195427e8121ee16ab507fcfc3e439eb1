      "message": "With these patches, the file in comment 2 of tdf#136838 takes around 40s to show the filtered result for me if I deselect the \"#N/A\" value in the column. This is much better now (previously it freezes), but still not good enough.\n\nI do not know the code, but maybe you guys can consider the suggestion I made in the initial report in tdf#136838? i.e. if I deselect the item \"#N/A\", then you should only do the \"the cell value does not equal to \"#N/A\"\" check, similar as if I use the standard filter (doing POMatch \u003c\u003e \"#N/A\" using standard filter takes only \u003c5s for me). If I deselect 2 items, then it should be a \"the cell value does not equal to A and does not equal to B\" check.",
