Description:
This module contains the third-party Redland RDF / librdf library, which
is needed to support data in RDF (Resource Description Framework) format.
It consists of 3 parts:
- raptor:  parsers and serializers for numerous RDF file formats
- rasqal:  query engine which supports SPARQL queries
- redland: librdf integrates raptor and rasqal, and provides numerous storage
           engines for storing RDF graphs (in memory, SQL, ...)

Libraries: libraptor, librasqal, librdf

Patches:
There are several patches, most of which contain only hacks to get it to
build with OOo build system.
There are also 3 patches that fix bugs in redland and are of general interest:
- redland-1.0.8.patch.free_null:
  redland destructor functions don't check if argument is NULL
- redland-1.0.8.patch.storage_hashes_context_serialize_get_statement:
  hashes storage: the function to create statements during serialization does
                  not fill in the context propery (i.e. context is NULL)
- redland-1.0.8.patch.storage_hashes_list_duplicates:
  hashes, list storage: if contexts are enabled, then it is possible to add
                        duplicate statements
