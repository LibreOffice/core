# Xcode Project for Debugging LibreOffice on macOS

Just an Xcode project to make it easier to debug a running `soffice`
instance on macOS. Not intended for other use. The Xcode project has
references to a fairly arbitrary bunch of source files from here and
there in LibreOffice that I have happened to debug in Xcode on macOS.
