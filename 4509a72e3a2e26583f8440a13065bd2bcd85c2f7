      "message": "One consequence of doing this triggered from cppuhelper::ServiceManager::disposing might be that Java components that have been instantiated at the remote end, and which happen to also be processed by cppuhelper::ServiceManager::disposing\u0027s loops, but happen to come after this JavaComponentLoader in those loops, have meanwhile become unreachable.  Hopefully, this should not be a problem, though, given that everything gets disposed now anyway.  (And is, to some extend, a consequence of the questionable overall design decision of using UNO itself to build parts of the UNO infrastructure like this JavaComponentLoader.)",
