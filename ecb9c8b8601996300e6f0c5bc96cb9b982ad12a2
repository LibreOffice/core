The proposal in https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/OFFICE-4107 has \"window-font-color\" for type text-color and \"transparent\" for type background-color. \"window-font-color\" would be new, but keyword \"transparent\" is already specified in ODF 1.2 as value for background-color.\n\u003e \n\u003e \"transparent\" makes sense for background color filter. Even more precise would be \"no-fill\", since in fact it filters by cells which have no background color at all, not a transparent color.\n\u003e \n\u003e Regarding text color filter, I cannot see how \"window-font-color\" fits here. If anything, the keyword should be \"automatic\". The color is chosen automatically based on the current background color and has nothing to do with a \"window font color\" (whatever that is).\n\u003e So that choice should probably be rethought in the proposal.\n\n@Michael: Any thoughts on the terminology here?",
