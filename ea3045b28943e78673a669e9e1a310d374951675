Initializing variables at declaration is just a nice to have and I saw no reasons to not do that.\nThe comment is just a memo to keep the variables, since evaluating indexed getToken/copy directly in the following function call would trigger undefined behavior (on top of losing some information about the meaning of the fields).",
