      "message": "Just to be sure, capacity, size and content of the vector will be the same in both cases but the pb with my change here is that it requires 2 allocations instead of 1 (1 at the initialization, 1 at the \"reserve\" method call).\nSince I suppose an allocation is expected longer than 2 push_back (which don\u0027t need extra allocation in the original version thanks to the call to \"reserve\"), it justifies the revert.\n\nAre you ok with this or did I miss anything?",
