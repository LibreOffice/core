You need to make the change closer to the string assignment code...\n\nMy idea is:\nthere is a difference in what Cell.String *returns* (so I\u0027d start at finding at what place there is the code that inserts LF vs CRLF into the result); *assigning* the string should be symmetrical - so after finding the code that I mentioned above, I\u0027d try to find a symmetrical code on assignment.",
