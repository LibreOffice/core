      "message": "Eike: what are your thoughts about these two patches?\n\nFor the swtable patch: I do kindof like the ability to specify a number format on a whole row and have that format stick even if there currently is text in the cells. At least that way when the user does enter a number, it will end up being formatted correctly right from the start. So I am less enthusiastic about that patch. (However, I also note that if a formatted number is replaced by text, then the formatting is removed also, so it isn\u0027t inconsistent to NOT apply in the first place.)",
