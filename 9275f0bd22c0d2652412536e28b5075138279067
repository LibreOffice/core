      "message": "This while loop block behaves as an if condition block.\n\nWhat is the use of getting the next entry with bEntry \u003d mxTreeBox-\u003eiter_next(*xEntry)? It is outside the loop block.\n\nThere is no need to loop. The \u0027No List\u0027 entry will always be the first entry. You are using get_iter_first to get the first entry. Checking that it succeeds and then doing the scroll_to_row and select seems like it will work to select the \u0027No List\u0027 entry when an empty rStr is passed, meaning the paragraph has no list style.",
