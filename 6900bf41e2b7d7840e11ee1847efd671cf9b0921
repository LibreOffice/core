      "message": "I also don\u0027t understand why break was used here. I\u0027m probably missing something,\nbut why break just to check if reallocate( pFragment ), possibly continue to loop,\nand end up looping over objects we\u0027ve already checked?\n\nCould this be condensed to something like the following?\n\n    if( !reallocate( pFragment ) )\n        // no break used here, we loop through all of the \"candidates\" in maFragments\n\nJust a thought. This loop was confusing, so I took my best shot at changing it.\nPlease let me know if I missed something!",
