      "message": "Why can\u0027t the interceptor return an actual dispatch object, which will listen to selection changes and send appropriate enable/disable status updates? Invalidating all the ui (all toolbars, menubar, statusbar etc.) just because a different image was selected, sounds like an overkill.",

      "message": "The trouble is that the dispatch interceptor can take the currently selected image into account, so we need to re-query the dispatch objects. See the testcase -- my real-world example is several images, where the toolbar button associated with .uno:SetBorderStyle is meant to be disabled when the image has a hyperlink set. Without this change, we don\u0027t re-query the dispatch objects, so if the first image you select (transitioning from text selection) has a link, the toolbar button is disabled, and it will remain disabled, even if you select a next image which doesn\u0027t have a hyperlink set. Similarly, there is missing update in the other direction: if you first select a without-hyperlink image first, then we keep the toolbar button enabled, and it\u0027ll be enabled even if you select a next image with a hyperlink instead.\n\nOr do you think there is a simpler way to make sure the enabled/disabled status of toolbar buttons is correct without calling contextChanged()?",
