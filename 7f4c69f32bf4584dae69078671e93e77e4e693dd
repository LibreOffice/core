I think it would be better to have a named symbolic constant for this, like NUM_RULE_DEFAULT_LEVELS or some such, especially if it\u0027s used in more than just this place. Btw, other places in editeng/ and sd/ use\n\n SvxNumRule aNumRule( NUM_BULLET_REL_SIZE|NUM_BULLET_COLOR|NUM_CHAR_TEXT_DISTANCE, 10 , sal_False);\n\nso maybe this one should also have these or\u0027ed values?",
