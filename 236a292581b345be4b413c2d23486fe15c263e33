      "message": "(1) when aLocation is empty, constructing a aURLObj from it is fine, and aURLObj.setExtension will return false, so no need to handle that case specially\n\n(2) better to use bIgnoreFinalSlash\u003dfalse in the calls to setExtension and getName; if aLocation is a URL with a path ending in a slash (so implicitly denoting a directory), better skip setting aFileOpenDialog.setDefaultName;  however, setExtension would still return true in that case (cf. \u003chttps://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id\u003d635d4b0eb8ccdec84d78c9b1d2aa113f6250e1f2\u003e \"Clarify some INetURLObject::setExtension behavior\"), so it needs to be preceeded by a check for !aURLObj.hasFinalSlash() (for which (1) holds, too)",
