Did you consider dumping the file to a GDIMetaFile and then assert that?\n\nSfxObjectShell::GetPreviewMetaFile() can be used for this, see sw/qa/core/layout/layout.cxx:412 for an example and include/vcl/mtfxmldump.hxx:44 for more documentation.\n\nIf the metafile-based test can work, that\u0027s better than a pixel assert.",
