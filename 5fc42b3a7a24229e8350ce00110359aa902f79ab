      "message": "Thanks for the link. Will change to the clang conventions and update the patch.\n\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure what to do about the merge conflict. I saw the changes made in the other patch, and I\u0027m not sure if they are correct. The owner of the patch using a different constructor of the Color class (the one which takes in transparency as well); I don\u0027t think that is needed, but I could be wrong. \n\nCould you tell me what to do about that?",
