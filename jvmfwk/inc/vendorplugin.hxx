/**

   <p>
   This API shall be implemented if one wants to support a Java Runtime
   Environment (JRE) of a particular vendor. Because there is currently no
   specification which rules the structure and location of JRE installations
   and the format of version strings it is not possible to supply a general
   implementation for all possible vendors. If an application determines exactly
   what version a JRE must have then it relies on certain features and bug
   fixes of that version. Because a version 1.4.2_1 from vendor X may contain
   different fixes as the same version from vendor Y it is important to see
   version and vendor as one entity. One without the other does not guarantee
   the existence of a particular set of features or bug fixes. An implementation
   of this API may support multiple vendors. </p>
   <p>
   Libraries which implement this interface will be dynamically loaded and
   unloaded by the java framework (jvmfwk/framework.h). Therefore they must not
   keep global variables.
