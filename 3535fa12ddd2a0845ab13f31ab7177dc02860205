      "message": "The basic idea here seems to be to add the number of characters in an aCache.wordboundary element to the startPos respectively endPos. That could be\n\n boundary.endPos +\u003d aCache.wordboundary[i];\n boundary.startPos +\u003d aCache.wordboundary[i-1];\n\nbut that may not work if there are surrogates (which actually is worth a check, maybe it does and using iterateCodePoints() isn\u0027t needed at this place?), so a loop that does iterateCodePoints(\u0026counter,1) until counter\u003e\u003daCache.wordboundary[i] would be correct and then boundary.endPos+\u003dcounter. Same for startPos and aCache.wordboundary[i-1].\n\nI suggest to step through this in the debugger and analyze what the code really does and what it should do.",
