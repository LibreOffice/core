      "message": "Since I was not able to revert to the defective commit, I manually removed the fix and tried to replicate the bug. Since I do not have a computer having windows, I was not able to confirm the re-appearance of the bug. Then I tried to use the development tools and looked at the property values of the objects. However, I couldn\u0027t notice the difference in FillProperties after saving and reloading. Maybe I am not looking at the right place. Also, the unit test that I wrote is failing for all the values of the FillStyle. It expects 1 and the actual is 0. But whenever I use FillStyle_NONE or FillStyle_SOLID they both end up with:\nExpected: 0\nActual: 1\n\nCan I get some code pointers to fix it?",
