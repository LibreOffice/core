      "message": "Note that this is slightly less efficient than the original code. It calls getArray() three times - for begin(), end(), and begin() (instead of once previously), with the related overhead; and also it creates (allocates and initializes) a lambda *object* (not a function, which would be possible if its capture list were empty).\n\nIn this case, plain range-based for would be more efficient than the new code (but slightly less efficient than old code, because of two getArray()s, because range-based for still needs to call end()).",
