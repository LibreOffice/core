15.1 Class 1

   A class 1 compliant resource MUST meet all "MUST" requirements in all
   sections of this document.

   Class 1 compliant resources MUST return, at minimum, the value "1" in
   the DAV header on all responses to the OPTIONS method.

15.2 Class 2

   A class 2 compliant resource MUST meet all class 1 requirements and
   support the LOCK method, the supportedlock property, the
   lockdiscovery property, the Time-Out response header and the Lock-
   Token request header.  A class "2" compliant resource SHOULD also
   support the Time-Out request header and the owner XML element.

   Class 2 compliant resources MUST return, at minimum, the values "1"
   and "2" in the DAV header on all responses to the OPTIONS method.
