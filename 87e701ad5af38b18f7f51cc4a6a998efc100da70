      "message": "... but here the named gradient is *unconditionally* overwritten by an unnamed gradient. Why that? Doesn\u0027t this affect selection of preset gradients? \n\nI\u0027d remove \u0027rSet-\u003ePut(...)\u0027 line above and keep this line the way it was, aString is impliticly empty. \n\nUnless ofc I missed something, with chart2 code one never knows :|",

      "message": "You are right in the unconditional part - this should go inside the else block, then the preset gradient would be selected in the dialog next time.\n\nThe key to this issue is, as far as I understand, that chart does not work correctly if the custom gradients name is not OUString(). This is why I removed aString.\n\nOther items like paragraph, shape, frame or slide background do not have this quirk.",
