I think it will be worth it :-)\n\nThis sounds promising. Please do one change at a time and push to gerrit for review. IMHO the only thing that needs UNO in drawinglayer is a wrapper to pass a container of primitives around - nothing else makes sense for usage through UNO. \n\n\u003e I would *not* move primitive stuff to vcl - it looks promising, but as soon as primitive stuff is used in vcl it will mix up stuff, make vcl not better and compromise the primitive concept. All necessary can be done in drawinglayer as I see it...\n\nThis is why I instead separated the drawinglayer into 2 libraries - one would serve as core implementation and interfaces and wouldn\u0027t depend on VCL (so it can be freely used there), the other part would be the rest. The minimum implementation is in [1], we can easily move needed classes to core if necessary. \n\n[1] https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/c/core/+/127286",
