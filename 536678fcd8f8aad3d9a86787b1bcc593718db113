I\u0027m not sure what approach would be better here, add \"noexcept\" now even in cases that could be defaulted, or clean up potential candidates that can be defaulted first.  One potential benefit of the first approach is that any additional functions (called from the move ctor in question) that you marked \"noexcept\" now will be marked so, and will mean that if we ever make the move ctor defaulted, it will indeed implicitly be noexcept.",
