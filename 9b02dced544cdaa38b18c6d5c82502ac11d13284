      "message": "This is problematic, ScVbaFileDialog is created with operator new, so at the time m_xItems is initialized its refcount is 0. Then you pass \"this\" as an uno::Reference temporary to ScVbaFileDialogSelectedItems, so by the time that returns, it\u0027ll delete ScVbaFileDialog.\n\nA possible way around this is to instead initialize m_xItems on-demand, when the caller of this ctor already put ScVbaFileDialog into an uno::Reference that increments the refcount.",
