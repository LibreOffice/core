/**
 * Status represents a result of a testing activity performed. The result is
 * described in two ways: state and runtime state. The state describes if the
 * activity was successful (OK state) or not (FAILED state). The runtime state
 * describes what happened during the activity: the test can be:
 *   - PASSED - the activity completed normally (although it can complete with
 *     FAILED state)
 *   - SKIPPED - the activity was not performed because of a reason (it also can
 *     has OK or FAILED state)
 *   - EXCEPTION - the activity was abnormally terminated because of an
 *     unexpected exception. It always has a FAILED state.
 *   - EXCLUDED - the activity is expected to fail. The state represents how
 *     the state really completed: OK or FAILED.
 *   - other variants are not formalized now and can be represented by
 *     Status.failed() method. They always have a FAILED state.
