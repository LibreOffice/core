    Fix not using texture barrier on StrokeTessOp.
    
    Previously we were overwriting the renderpassXferBarriers flag on
    ProgramInfo to set it to kNone. This flag is meant to say whether or not
    the entire render pass uses barriers or not. This is needed in Vulkan
    because all pipelines in a render pass that has an input attachment
    must bind the input attachment regardless if it is used or not. So the
    pipeline must be created with a layout for an input attachment
    descriptor set.
    
    This change just removes to performance optimization to only use the
    barrier on the stencil and not fill draw. This use case shouldn't
    come up too often and also shouldn't be a big perf hit regardless.
    The way GrAppliedClip is created/used it is hard for us to create
    multiple different Pipeline objects: one for stencil and one for the
    fill.
