Contains the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries from Mozilla

== Fips 140 and signed libraries ==

Fips 140 mode is not supported. That is, the *.chk files containing the
checksums for the cryptographic module are not delivered into instdir and will
not be part of the OOo installation sets.

Signing has been turned off because
- we change the rpath (install names)  after signing which breaks the signatures
(Mac)
- sqlite conflicts with the system sqlite when signing which breaks the build

== libsqlite3 ==

With all supported Mac OS X SDK we use
NSS_USE_SYSTEM_SQLITE=1
to build using the system sqlite.

== system NSS on Linux ==

Note that different Linux distributions use different SONAMEs for the
NSS libraries, so it is not possible to use --with-system-nss and build
a portable generic LO installation set, despite NSS upstream apparently
maintaining ABI compatibility.

Debian Squeeze:
0x000000000000000e (SONAME)             Library soname: [libnss3.so.1d]
Fedora 20:
0x000000000000000e (SONAME)             Library soname: [libnss3.so]

For the record, the LSB specified SONAME is libnss3.so
