Contains the Network Security Services (NSS) libraries from Mozilla

== ESR versions ==

Upstream releases both regular and "ESR" versions, the latter go into Firefox
ESR and Thunderbird.

There is a new ESR version about once a year, and a ESR version gets micro
updates only when there are security issues to fix, and it's not always obvious
from the release notes of a regular release if there are security issues that
are relevant to LibreOffice, hence it's probably best to bundle only the ESR
versions and upgrade for every micro release (as recommended by upstream).

== Fips 140 and signed libraries ==

Fips 140 mode is not supported. That is, the *.chk files containing the
checksums for the cryptographic module are not delivered into instdir and will
not be part of the OOo installation sets.

Signing has been turned off because
- we change the rpath (install names)  after signing which breaks the signatures
(Mac)
- sqlite conflicts with the system sqlite when signing which breaks the build

== libsqlite3 ==

With all supported macOS SDK we use
NSS_USE_SYSTEM_SQLITE=1
to build using the system sqlite.
