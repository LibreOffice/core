JavaScript engine/interpreter written in Java, used to provide JavaScript extensions.

The Scripting Framework makes use of the Rhino ([http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/])
JavaScript interpreter, available under the Mozilla Public License
([http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html]).

In addition, to support the debugging of scripts contained in OpenOffice.org
documents, we have modified the Java source file Main.java.

The Rhino source tarball is unpacked and patched with the modified code. The
Rhino Jar file (js.jar) is then built (download/swingExSrc.zip is unpacked and
built as part of this procesS) and delivered to the solver. The file
rhino1_5R5.patch contains the changes made in order to build Rhino. The patch
was generated using the command: diff -wurN
