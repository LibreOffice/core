udunits allows for parsing and manipulation of (physical) units.

Important: when updating it's necessary to obtain the tarball from
the official ftp site:
    ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/udunits/
The tarballs from the github repository are missing autoconf and
info files, i.e using these would require the installation of additional
tooling, beyond what we already require for LibreOffice.
