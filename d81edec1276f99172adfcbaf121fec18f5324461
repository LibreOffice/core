      "message": "This code will only ever create a DBase connection (connectivity/source/drivers/dbase/ ; which in C++ terms inherits from File connectivity/source/drivers/file ), so the reference to ODBC, MySQL or any other driver makes no sense.\n\nIn the context of tdf#116171, only the extension to connectivity/source/drivers/file/FConnection.cxx and  \noffapi/c/s/s/FILEConnectionProperties.idl are relevant.\n\nWhether ODBC would benefit from a similar extension is a different question. In so far as no code ever puts an integer as the CharSet property of an ODBC connection, this patch creates dead code in connectivity/s/d/odbc/OConnection.cxx ; well, not really because user code (a Python / Basic / ... macro or a C++ extension) may now do it.",
