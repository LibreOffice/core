(What I observe is that the python.bin process is already at tearDown, while the soffice.bin process hangs yielding in AbstractScImportAsciiDlg_Impl::Execute, waiting for input.)  Some synchronization appears to be missing, so that this Python test code waits for the \"Text Import\" dialog to show up.",
