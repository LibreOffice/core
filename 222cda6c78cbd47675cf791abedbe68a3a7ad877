But setting node properties (isGrey) is very much the duty of PropertyToTreeNode. So I wanted that you pass a boolean value to PropertyToTreeNode (i.e., the value of rIsDefined[rPropName]), which would be used there to make it grey; but setting the map value to true should be done here, as now. Does it make sense?",
