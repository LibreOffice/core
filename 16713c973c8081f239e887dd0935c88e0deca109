      "message": "I have a problem with counting the records here whenever the cursor is moved in a DB area. Doing so can significantly slow down things in large DB areas where several alternating (filter matched / did not match) ranges are affected by the filters. This would hit on every cursor movement.\n\nI\u0027d rather see some caching inside GetFilterSelCount() of the value determined for a specific ScDBArea. Of course that would need to be invalidated whenever another ScDBArea is touched or a filter changed, which may not be that trivial.",
