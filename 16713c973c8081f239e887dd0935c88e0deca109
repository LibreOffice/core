      "message": "These lines are to get the total number of rows(both filtered and unfiltered) inside a filter. HasAutofilter and ScDBData::GetArea seems quite fast in its implementation. GetArea especially seems to get the numbers cheaply(no counting). ScDBCollection::GetDBAtCursor iterates through all DBs to find the DB at the cursor. This may be costly if there are a lot of DBs. Do we have to improve this using the mdds::rectangle_set data structure instead ?",

      "message": "I have a problem with counting the records here whenever the cursor is moved in a DB area. Doing so can significantly slow down things in large DB areas where several alternating (filter matched / did not match) ranges are affected by the filters. This would hit on every cursor movement.\n\nI\u0027d rather see some caching inside GetFilterSelCount() of the value determined for a specific ScDBArea. Of course that would need to be invalidated whenever another ScDBArea is touched or a filter changed, which may not be that trivial.",
