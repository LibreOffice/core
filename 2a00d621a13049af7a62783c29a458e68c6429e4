      "message": "This looks reasonable to me; the context of the referred commit was Online, where we always type using IME and there the usual \"enter at the end of heading 1 turns into body text\" logic was broken. So that was all about insertion, makes sense to move that logic inside the insert conditional.\n\nUnless Szymon can spot something with this. :-)",
