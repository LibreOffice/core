      "message": "Oh! Thanks to the last change (*thank you!*), I now see *this* change. And I realize, that mnWidth / mnHeight are now unused, right? At least they never change, being always 0 after initialization in ctor? I suppose that they should be also removed, their getters removed, too -\u003e their uses removed, too... and *then* you may safely rename CompareIgnoreSize to simply Compare (because there will not be members that are left out from the comparison).",
