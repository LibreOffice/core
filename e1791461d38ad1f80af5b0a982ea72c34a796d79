      "message": "* In case multiple tabs are selected, the command remains enabled but nothing happens (the dialog copies all selected sheets). Would just _disable_ the command.\n* Stumbled over this by reading the source comments. And in fact no sheet operations are possible when track changes is active. Totally wrong from usability POV is to _hide_ temporarily unavailable commands. And that happens also for the duplicate menu item. Please fix it, if possible.\n* Minor issue last: A sheet named \"A\" becomes \"A_2_2\" while copying per dialog makes it \"A_2\".\n",
