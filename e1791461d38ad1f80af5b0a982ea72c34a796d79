IMO we should keep this possibility of duplicating multiple tabs at once.\n\n\u003e Stumbled over this by reading the source comments. And in fact no sheet operations are possible when track changes is active. Totally wrong from usability POV is to _hide_ temporarily unavailable commands.\nActually that code snipped (which was copied from FID_TAB_MOVE) is not needed. If you look at line 991 the command FID_TAB_DUPLICATE is disabled if rDoc.GetChangeTrack() is set. So I removed the unnecessary code. We could also delete this code from FID_TAB_MOVE as well, but I\u0027m not sure there would be other implications.\n\nMoreover, I ran tests with Track Changes active and the Duplicate Sheet command is disabled (hence not available for use). Turning off Track Changes enables the Duplicate Sheet command.",
