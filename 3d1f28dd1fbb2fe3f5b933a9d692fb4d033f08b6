      "message": "\u003e Any reason you effectively dropped test_openldap\u003dyes for this case?\n\nNope. I had a hard time to guess / dig up intention and made some errors / missed stuff. The whole point of the change was to make test dependencies more obvious and eventually replace long lists of per-architecture test_* settings. Interestingly, your LO PostgreSQL build now must use the system OpenLDAP. I probably just assumed MacOS wouldn\u0027t use / provide a system OpenLDAP, like the tinderboxes. So just add a test_openldap\u003dyes, like I already did for Haiku.\n\nOr maybe it\u0027s better to keep test_openldap\u003dyes the default and not depend on X11 at all and drop it from the disable_x11_tests() list. It definitely doesn\u0027t have a hard dependency on X11 and quite probably makes sense in a headless build too.",

My incremental build started to fail, as the stale libpq.a still referenced OpenLDAP symbols, but a newly linked Library_libpostgresql-sdbc-impl, which links against libpq.a, no longer links against OpenLDAP.\n\n\u003e Or maybe it\u0027s better to keep test_openldap\u003dyes the default and not depend on X11 at all and drop it from the disable_x11_tests() list.
