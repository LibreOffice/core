      "message": "CellColorHandler::getProperties seems to handle some \"Code from binary word filter (the values are out of 1000)\", which likely is a better match; and some values there seem to relate to things like \"Dark Diagonal Cross\", etc. RTF must be close to the old binary format feature-wise - it was created as \"open\"/\"human-reradable\" counterpart to the binary format. Should that code in binary filter be found and reused maybe?\n\n[1] https://opengrok.libreoffice.org/xref/core/writerfilter/source/dmapper/CellColorHandler.cxx?r\u003d30bd841e#151",
