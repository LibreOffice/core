      "message": "I dislike this name (although it\u0027s indeed raii). HBRUSHUniquePtr.hxx - or GDISmartPtr - seems better; it has the benefit to be unique enough to not provoke duplicate names if someone decides to follow this track and introduce a \"raii.hxx\" in a different place. In not a single occasion, I had to do several attempts when looked for a file with relevant functionality, when all I knew was its name, but not its location (e.g., it still happens for me working on PVS Studio report).",
