Or alternatively, whether this code path is reached all the time without anything being wrong, and in that vase the warning is totally useless.\n\nWe much prefer real assert() to wishy-washy SAL_WARNs. One never knows whether a SAL_WARN is something serious that should actually be acted upon, or a rare or perhaps a bit unexpected situation that the code anyway handles just fine. At least, that is how I feel, when I see the tons of warnings one gets in a perfectly normally working LibreOffice. Sorry for the rant.",
