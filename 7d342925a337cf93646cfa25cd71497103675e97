These strings don\u0027t make sense in commit message (the description of what the patch is for and what it does); the message must tell something useful to someone who is going to read it in 6 months or in 2 years. Things that are only relevant to the process of preparing the patch should go to gerrit comments, not to commit message. Thanks!",
