      "message": "There is something strange going on now.\n\nI\u0027ve locally upgraded the video presentation (I now switched off sound, because I\u0027ll otherwise get crazy over it), by adding a slide before and after the video with OpenGL / Fade transition. If I forward via keyboard to the black \"exit presentation\" screen and then go back to the video slide, neither mouse nor keyboard work). I guess it\u0027s some focus problem and I manually need to forward the events (or non-accept them).\n\nThere is the other problem, that going back from the \"exit presentation\" skips the last slide, but that is not related to this bug / patch and needs some extra fix / report.",
