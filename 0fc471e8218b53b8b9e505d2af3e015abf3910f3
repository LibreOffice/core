      "message": "Good question, I forgot to mention why. For reasons unknown to me, boolean configuration settings are read only on the expert configuration dialog, int/long values can be edited. This is not just in master, but e.g. in version 6.0 as part of openSUSE too. I didn\u0027t investigate whether this is as designed or a bug, as the focus of the current patch is the error rectangle code.\nStoring the setting in configuration and/or in the document and UI implementation to (un)set isn\u0027t final yet.",

(As you mention \"version 6.0\", it seems that you are talking about a generic issue, not a specific issue with this patch?  But there are certainly many properties of boolean type in the registry, and I don\u0027t see a reason why this specific property should be of type int when it actually models a yes/no option.)",
