This is not just in master, but e.g. in version 6.0 as part of openSUSE too. I didn\u0027t investigate whether this is as designed or a bug, as the focus of the current patch is the error rectangle code.\nStoring the setting in configuration and/or in the document and UI implementation to (un)set isn\u0027t final yet.",
