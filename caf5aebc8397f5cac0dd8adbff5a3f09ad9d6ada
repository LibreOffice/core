I suppose that the old way testing it in build directory makes more sense: it\u0027s the build directory where the build-time failure likely happens, because source directory is not modified while building, and if something suspicious was there, antivirus would already broken it there...\n\nBut I could be wrong and both directories may suffer from AV. So possibly two successive tests would be necessary: one in $SRC_DIR/eicar (with error if failed), then immediately one in current directory\u0027s eicar.",
