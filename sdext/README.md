Extensions for the Impress and Draw applications.

source/pdfimport/ - PDF import

	Uses an external poppler process to parse and handle PDF
	import as draw shapes.

source/minimizer/ - Presentation Minimizer

	Shrinks presentations by down-scaling images, and removing
	extraneous eg. embedded OLE content.

source/presenter/ - Impress / Presenter Console.

	This couples to sd/ in rather strange ways. Its design is
	heavily mangled by an attempt to use only UNO interfaces
	which are highly inadequate. This leads to somewhat
	ridiculous situations. Activating in response to
	configuration keys (for example), and the 'XPresenterHelper'
	interface inside sd/ used to create and manage windows.

    The main screen uses a hardware-accelerated
    canvas (e.g. cairo canvas), while the entire secondary screen
    uses a VCL-canvas that is created in
    sd::framework::FullScreenPane::CreateCanvas().

    The secondary screen contains 3 "Panes" which each have
    2 XWindows for the border area & the actual content,
    and each content Pane is backed by a sd::presenter::PresenterCanvas
    that wraps the FullScreenPane's canvas and does clipping.
