      "message": "[$k$-409] is odd because the \u0027k\u0027 becomes part of the currency symbol, while actually it\u0027s only some unit string so it should be \"k\"[$$-409] or \\k[$$-409] (to be escaped for a literal string of course). Though it doesn\u0027t really matter here because it isn\u0027t saved to file, otherwise the cell would have office:currency\u003d\"k$\" instead of office:currency\u003d\"USD\" and the format \u003cnumber:currency-symbol\u003ek$\u003c/number:currency-symbol\u003e instead of \u003cnumber:currency-symbol\u003e$\u003c/number:currency-symbol\u003e\n\nI\u0027ll change that on the fly.",
